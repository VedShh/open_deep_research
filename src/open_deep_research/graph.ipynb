Introduction\\n---------------\\n\\nThe era of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a dramatic shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques ([Velásquez-Henao et al., 2023](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-26-31857)). Among these advancements, natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a pivotal domain, enabling seamless human-computer interactions. Large language models (LLMs) represent a transformative milestone in AI, particularly in the field of conversational AI, which includes models such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing Chat ([Kim, 2010](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-12-31857); [Qin et al., 2022](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-21-31857)). These models leverage deep learning architectures, such as the transformer ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-27-31857)), to process and generate human-like text.\\n\\nChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, has gained widespread attention for its ability to generate contextually coherent and semantically rich responses ([Wu et al., 2023](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-29-31857)). Google Bard, with its foundation in Google’s advanced PaLM 2 architecture, excels in multilingual capabilities and creative text generation ([Anil et al., 2023](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-2-31857)). Microsoft Bing Chat, powered by GPT-4 and Microsoft’s proprietary Prometheus model, integrates conversational AI directly into search, offering highly contextual and relevant responses ([Chowdhery et al., 2022](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-7-31857)). Despite their individual strengths, the comparative evaluation of these models across critical metrics remains an underexplored area, which this study aims to address.\\n\\nTo provide a nuanced understanding of these conversational AI models, this paper adopts a structured evaluation framework. By leveraging user-generated responses, we assess key metrics such as fluency, coherence, relevance, accuracy, creativity, and completeness. This study contributes to an evolving field by identifying the distinctive strengths of each model, offering insights into their practical applications, and proposing future research directions.\\n\\nDespite discussions on the topic, there is a research gap in state-of-the-art literature regarding systematic and comparative studies. With the aim of filling this gap, the present paper proposes a comprehensive comparison using prompt engineering, an AI technique refining LLMs’ performance through specific prompts. Trial questions assess Google Bard AI, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Bing AI, aiming to provide insights for informed decisions and contribute to the evolving landscape of AI technology.\\n\\n2. Introduction to Key Technologies and Concepts\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### 2.1 Natural Language Processing\\n\\nNatural language processing (NLP), situated at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, focuses on the interaction between human language and computational systems. It strives to enable machines to understand, interpret, and respond meaningfully to human language, addressing challenges such as natural language production, semantic analysis, grammar, pragmatics, and understanding. Drawing from various disciplines, NLP plays a crucial role in empowering computers to engage with human language across diverse applications.\\n\\n### 2.2 Evolution of Natural Language Processing\\n\\nThe evolution of NLP has transitioned from rule-based systems to ML techniques and, more prominently, to deep learning approaches. Initially, NLP utilized rule-based approaches, with linguists and experts manually setting rules to understand language, which had inherent limitations due to the intricate nature of language ([Kim, 2010](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-12-31857)). This phase was succeeded by ML-based techniques, particularly deep learning models, which enable computers to automatically learn language patterns directly from data ([Samant et al., 2022](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-23-31857)).\\n\\nOne pivotal advancement in this journey is the development of word embeddings, which are vector representations of words that capture their semantic and syntactic relationships. Notable models such as Word2Vec and GloVe have played crucial roles in generating these embeddings from vast textual data, thus allowing for more profound language comprehension ([Biswas and De, 2022](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-4-31857)).\\n\\nSubsequently, techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have been instrumental in modelling sequential language data, such as in machine translation. Meanwhile, transformers have emerged as powerful tools for addressing long-range dependencies in text, proving beneficial for tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis ([Qin et al., 2022](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-21-31857)).\\n\\nDriving this progress in NLP are a series of factors, including the surge in available text data from sources such as the internet and social media, as well as the advances in computational hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). These have facilitated the development, training, and deployment of complex models at an exponential rate.\\n\\nThe surge in computational methods and their applications in NLP, coupled with vast data availability, has strongly propelled the academic community to focus on this research area. In a recent study conducted by [Chen et al. (2022)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-6-31857), the bibliographic data of NLP scientific papers were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The search query used in the study was based on prior reviews of NLP ([Kreimeyer et al., 2017](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-16-31857); [Pons et al., 2016](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-19-31857)). The search generated a total of 31,485 NLP papers. The study analyzed the number of NLP papers by year and found that there has been an overall growing tendency in the number of NLP-related scientific papers from 1999 to 2021 ([Chen et al., 2022](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-6-31857)). The study also identified three stages of development in NLP research. From 1999 to 2005, there was a slow growth tendency. From 2006 to 2016, a steady growth tendency was witnessed. From 2017 to 2021, there was a fast growth in the number of NLP papers ([Chen et al., 2022](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-6-31857)). Furthermore, the study examined the funding information in the Acknowledgements section of each NLP paper and identified the top seven agencies that provided the most grants for supporting NLP research. These agencies included the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the United States Department of Health and Human Service, the National Institutes of Health, the European Commission, Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the National Key Research and Development Program of China, and National Science Foundation ([Chen et al., 2022](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-6-31857)).\\n\\n#### 2.2.1. NLP Market Size Worldwide\\n\\nConsidering the evolution of NLP and the growing academic attention it has received; it is imperative to compare this progression with real-world market dynamics. The research landscape and technological breakthroughs often serve as precursors to market growth and application viability. This is seen in current market insight forecasts from August 2023 by [Statista (2023)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-25-31857).\\n\\nThe market size of the NLP market, as illustrated in [Figure 1](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#fig-1-31857) from Statista Market Insights Forecast ([Statista, 2023](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-25-31857)), was estimated at €22.24bn in 2023. The market size is expected to also show a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.47 %, resulting in a market volume of €60.89bn by 2030. This projection is driven by several factors, including the increasing demand for NLP solutions in the enterprise sector, the growing popularity of chatbots and virtual assistants, and the growing need to extract insights from unstructured data. This projected market trajectory of NLP not only validates academic endeavors but also offers a pragmatic lens through which we can assess the tangible impact of these innovations as NLP continuously evolves.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/version/37338/30929/127582/fig-1-31857.jpg)\\n\\n_Figure 1.

Emergence of Large Language Models\\n\\nIn recent years, notable paradigm shifts in AI, particularly in NLP, have been marked by the evolution of LLMs. LLMs have significantly impacted diverse domains, from language translation to code generation and drug discovery, owing to their sophisticated architectures, extensive parameters, and rigorous training methodologies. The historical transition from rule-based or statistical methods to data-driven approaches, which leverage neural networks and deep learning techniques, reflects the growth of computational capacities.\\n\\nThe emergence of language models is discussed in the “Linguistic Data Model for Natural Languages and Artificial Intelligence. Part 4. Language” journal ([Kim, 2010](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-12-31857)) attributing it to the development of a world model that necessitates language in an open form. Dynamic knowledge graphs, as highlighted by [Kingma and Ba (2014)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-13-31857), contribute to enhancing language models’ comprehension of textual data, creating a dynamic knowledge base that can differentiate between facts and stories. [Koubaa et al. (2023)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-14-31857) emphasize that LLMs exhibit not only excellent few-shot learning with task-specific exemplars but also decent zero-shot reasoning, showcasing their capacity for complex reasoning even in novel situations.\\n\\nThe study of [Kovan and Márta (2023)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-15-31857) delves into human interactions with LLMs, revealing participants’ strategies, such as explicit reasoning requests and pursuing multiple approaches for each question. These studies collectively underscore the diverse capabilities of LLMs in language understanding, reasoning, scalable oversight, and human-machine interactions, advancing the field of natural language processing.\\n\\nThe true emergence of LLMs began with the realization that increasing model size and utilizing vast training data could enhance language understanding and generation tasks significantly. Symbolic models such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) by OpenAI, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) from Google, and text-to-text transfer transformer (T5) mark this transformative era in AI. The field has rapidly advanced with the introduction of powerful models such as Google’s language model for dialogue applications (LaMDA) and parallel language model (PaLM) 2, capable of generating more human-like text, accurate language translation, and comprehensive question answering. [Table 1](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#tabw-1-31857) shows the summary of major Large Language Models architectures.\\n\\n_Table 1.

Key Architectures in LLMs\\n\\nThe cornerstone of most LLMs is their underlying architecture. The architecture defines how data is processed, relationships are modelled, and outputs are generated.\\n\\n1.Transformer architecture: Introduced by [Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-27-31857), the authors’ transformer architecture has quickly become the gold standard for LLMs. Its self-attention mechanism allows models to dynamically weigh input tokens, making it particularly adept at capturing long-range dependencies in data. The authors demonstrated that this architecture significantly outperformed previous models in tasks such as machine translation ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-27-31857)).\\n\\n2.RNNs: Before the rise of transformers, RNNs, especially their variants such as LSTM, were the preferred choice. LSTM was introduced as a solution to the vanishing gradient problem observed in traditional RNNs, making the training of deeper networks feasible.\\n\\nRecent advances in LLM architectures include:\\n\\n1.Sparse LLMs: Sparse LLMs have fewer parameters but can achieve comparable performance to dense LLMs. This is achieved by using techniques such as parameter pruning and knowledge distillation.\\n\\n2.Transformer-based architectures for specific tasks: Transformer-based architectures have been extended to support a variety of tasks, such as text summarization and question answering. This has led to significant improvements in performance in these tasks.\\n\\n#### 2.3.3. LLMs Training and Parameters\\n\\nLLM training is a complex interplay of data, optimization strategies, and regularization techniques.\\n\\n•Data and curriculum learning: While most LLMs rely on vast web data, the sequence in which data is presented also impacts performance. [Bengio et al. (2009)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-3-31857) proposed a curriculum learning strategy, where models are first exposed to simpler tasks before transitioning to complex ones, analogous to human learning.\\n\\n•Optimization: Techniques such as the Adam optimizer have become standard in LLM training. [Kingma and Ba (2014)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-13-31857) introduced Adam, demonstrating its superiority over traditional methods such as stochastic gradient descent in terms of convergence speed and stability.\\n\\n•Regularization and robustness: Regularization techniques prevent overfitting in large models. [Srivastava et al. (2014)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-24-31857) introduced dropout as a simple yet effective regularization method, randomly deactivating a subset of neurons during training to improve generalization. Moreover, the robustness of models, especially concerning adversarial attacks, has gained attention. In a pioneering study, [Goodfellow et al. (2014)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-9-31857) explored the susceptibility of neural networks to adversarial examples, sparking a plethora of research on enhancing model robustness.\\n\\nRecent advances in LLM training dynamics:\\n\\n•Self-supervised learning: Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled LLMs to be trained on large amounts of unlabeled data. This has led to significant improvements in performance in a variety of tasks.\\n\\n•Adversarial training: Adversarial training is a technique that can be used to improve the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks. This is achieved by training the LLM to distinguish between real and adversarial examples.\\n\\nParameters are the heart and soul of neural networks, storing the learned knowledge and shaping the model’s performance. Recent advances in LLM parameter scaling:\\n\\n•Sparse LLMs: Sparse LLMs have fewer parameters but can achieve comparable performance to dense LLMs. This is achieved by using techniques such as parameter pruning and knowledge distillation.\\n\\nEfficient training algorithms: New training algorithms have been developed that can train LLMs with trillions of parameters in a reasonable amount of time.\\n\\n### 2.4 Introduction to Chatbots\\n\\nChatbots are commonly internet-based computer programs, specifically designed to simulate conversations with human users. These conversational agents leverage advanced technologies such as NLP and AI to comprehend and respond to user inputs in a manner that mimics human interaction. The fundamental objective of chatbots is to foster meaningful conversations by furnishing information, addressing queries, or aiding in specific tasks. The key characteristics of chatbots include:\\n\\n•Simulation of human conversation in understanding and responding to natural language queries, thus maintaining conversations with users over multiple turns.\\n\\n•They are powered by AI and NLP to understand the intent of user queries and generate appropriate responses. This allows them to be more flexible and responsive than traditional chatbots that are based on rule-based systems.\\n\\nIn recent years, chatbots have emerged as valuable tools in the realm of artificial intelligence, revolutionizing the way humans interact with technology. Chatbots, also known as conversational agents or virtual assistants, are software applications that utilize NLP and machine learning algorithms to simulate human-like conversations, enabling users to interact with systems, services, or information through textual or auditory methods ([Gupta et al., n.d](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-11-31857).).

Literature Review of Three Conversational AI Models\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### 3.1 ChatGPT: A Comprehensive Overview\\n\\n#### 3.1.1. Large Language Models\\n\\nOpen AI developed ChatGPT, a model that leads the market in the areas of NLP and conversational AI. OpenAI has released this model as a branch of the GPT model family. ChatGPT was specifically developed to ensure the output is a human-like conversational response to a prompt rather than just filled in text. It is a stunning new step in the evolution of language models, revealing the immense power of planning for language nuances, context, and coherence. ChatGPT’s core philosophy is based on the advancements in transformer architectures. We know that transformers capture dependencies and contextual information within sequential data of great length quite well. Therefore, it becomes possible for ChatGPT to understand and formulate responses in a conversation which makes it applicable in a large number of areas ranging from chatbots to content creation and others. ChatGPT has been profoundly developed by the evolution of GPT models. And as we explore its development it is impossible to ignore the fact that language models have undergone rigorous refining processes over the years. With each new version of GPT, OpenAI has demonstrated its dedication to expanding the frontier of language understanding, and each newer model attempts to build upon the successes and address the limitations of its predecessors. This iterative approach has played a pivotal role in shaping the capabilities of ChatGPT.\\n\\nIn terms of sheer technical architecture, ChatGPT inherits the fundamental architecture of GPT models, which relies on a transformer-based neural network. The transformer architecture, introduced by [Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-27-31857) has become a cornerstone in NLP, facilitating parallel processing of input sequences and enabling the model to attend to different parts of the input text simultaneously. This architecture, which is explored further in subsequent sections, has proven to be highly effective in capturing intricate linguistic patterns and dependencies.\\n\\n#### 3.1.2. Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Models\\n\\nNatural language processing (NLP) has undergone a paradigm shift with the introduction of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, which are distinguished by their capacity to learn and produce coherent, contextually relevant text. The foundation of GPT models, such as ChatGPT, is the transformer architecture, which was first presented by [Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-27-31857). An important breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP) is the transformer design, which allows the model to use self-attention processes to capture contextual information and long-range dependencies.\\n\\nGenerative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models are a series of language models developed by OpenAI, specifically designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks ([Ahmed et al., n.d](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-1-31857).; [Ray, 2023](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-22-31857); [Koubaa et al., 2023](https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/article/download/31857/30929?inline=1#ref-14-31857)). The importance of these models in AI increased primarily due to their impact on NLP in the recent past. Additionally, these models have had a ripple effect on the deep learning research community. The GPT models are based on the transformer architecture, which is a disruptive technology in sequence to sequence modeling, as it outperforms previous models based on RNNs or CNNs. The transformer architecture has a self-attention mechanism in which the model learns to attend to the specific parts of the variable length input sequence, which enables the model to capture long range dependencies. It helps the models to manage and analyze the more complex structures of a language and to perform a number of other related tasks such as understanding and generation of language. Additionally, the transformer architecture \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 5: A Comparative Analysis of Leading Large Language Models: Grok 3 ... ---\\nURL: https://medium.com/@farhanahmed625/a-comparative-analysis-of-leading-large-language-models-grok-3-openais-gpt-4o-and-google-s-1202cc82b118\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nThis report provides a comprehensive, up-to-date comparison of three leading contenders: xAI\\'s Grok AI (specifically Grok 3), OpenAI\\'s latest\\n\\nFULL CONTENT:\\nSign up\\n\\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40farhanahmed625%2Fa-comparative-analysis-of-leading-large-language-models-grok-3-openais-gpt-4o-and-google-s-1202cc82b118&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n\\nSign up\\n\\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40farhanahmed625%2Fa-comparative-analysis-of-leading-large-language-models-grok-3-openais-gpt-4o-and-google-s-1202cc82b118&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png)\\n\\n# A Comparative Analysis of Leading Large Language Models: Grok 3, OpenAI’s GPT-4o, and Google’s Gemini\\n\\n![FARHAN AHMED](https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:64:64/0*jMnReuqVCLFEmnOc)\\n\\n--\\n\\nListen\\n\\nShare\\n\\nThe artificial intelligence landscape is currently undergoing a rapid transformation, driven by the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs).

Introduction: The Evolving Landscape of Large Language Models**\\n\\nThe artificial intelligence landscape is currently undergoing a rapid transformation, driven by the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs). This report provides a comprehensive, up-to-date comparison of three leading contenders: xAI’s Grok AI (specifically Grok 3), OpenAI’s latest models (such as GPT-4o and GPT-4.1), and Google’s Gemini family (including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash). Each of these models represents a distinct approach to AI development, offering unique capabilities, architectural designs, and strategic positioning within the competitive market. Understanding their comparative strengths, weaknesses, and recent developments is crucial for stakeholders navigating the complexities of AI adoption and innovation.\\n\\n**2. Model Overviews and Key Developments**\\n\\nThis section provides a foundational understanding of each model, detailing their origins, latest iterations, and overarching design philosophies.\\n\\n**2.1. Grok AI (Focus on Grok 3)**\\n\\nGrok AI is developed by xAI, a company founded by Elon Musk. Grok 3 represents the latest flagship model in the series, launched in February 2025, building upon its predecessors, Grok 2, Grok 1.5, and Grok 1.1 The development of Grok 3 necessitated immense computational resources, leveraging the Colossus supercluster, which is equipped with 100,000 to 200,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs.1 This infrastructure signifies a tenfold increase in computing power compared to earlier leading models.6\\n\\nThe core philosophy behind Grok is its ambition to be a “maximally truth-seeking AI,” designed to tackle controversial questions and explore boundaries that other AI systems might avoid.7 This foundational principle underpins several of Grok 3’s unique features. It introduces a “Reasoning Slider” that allows users to adjust the AI’s cognitive effort, balancing speed and depth of thought.4 For rapid research and information synthesis, “DeepSearch” automates data gathering and distills vast internet information into concise answers.1 A “Big Brain” mode is available to allocate additional computational resources for solving highly complex problems, ensuring more accurate results.1 Furthermore, Grok 3 includes a “Think” mode, which articulates its internal thought process, providing users with a step-by-step understanding of how it arrives at its conclusions.1\\n\\nA defining characteristic of Grok is its tight integration with the X platform (formerly Twitter). This connection enables real-time access to current events, breaking news, and trending topics, allowing Grok to provide highly relevant and up-to-the-minute responses.9 Beyond its technical capabilities, Grok is distinguished by its unique personality. It is known for a witty, sarcastic, and humorous tone, offering users a choice between a “Regular Mode” for straightforward, factual answers and a “Fun Mode” for a more “unhinged” and playful interaction.9 This duality aims to create a more engaging and human-like conversational experience. Grok models are primarily accessible to X Premium+ subscribers.11 They are also available for enterprise use via Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI service 12 and Microsoft Azure AI Foundry.6\\n\\n**2.2. OpenAI’s Latest Models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4.1)**\\n\\nOpenAI has continued to rapidly evolve its foundational models, with several key releases in its GPT-4 series. GPT-4o, where “o” stands for “omni,” was initially released in May 2024. This model marked a significant advancement as a multilingual and multimodal generative pre-trained transformer, capable of natively processing and generating text, images, and audio.13 It succeeded the GPT-4 Turbo model.13\\n\\nFollowing GPT-4o, OpenAI introduced GPT-4o mini in July 2024. This is a smaller, more cost-effective version of GPT-4o, which replaced GPT-3.5 Turbo on the ChatGPT interface, making advanced capabilities more accessible.13 Further pushing the boundaries, GPT-4.1 was released in April 2025. This model is positioned as a successor to GPT-4o, offering further improvements in reasoning capabilities and efficiency, notably featuring a significantly larger context window.17\\n\\nThe multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o have seen continuous expansion. Its ability to generate images, later officially named GPT Image 1, was released in March 2025, effectively replacing DALL-E 3 within ChatGPT.13 The Advanced Voice Mode of ChatGPT, powered by GPT-4o’s native audio processing, was rolled out in September 2024.13 Recognizing the growing demand for tailored AI solutions, OpenAI also introduced a feature in August 2024 that allows corporate customers to fine-tune GPT-4o using their proprietary company data, enabling specialized applications for specific tasks or industries.13\\n\\n**2.3. Google’s Gemini Family (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Flash, Lite)**\\n\\nThe Gemini family of multimodal large language models was announced by Google DeepMind in December 2023, serving as the strategic successor to Google’s earlier AI models, LaMDA and PaLM 2.18 The Gemini chatbot, which is the user-facing application of these models, was initially launched as Bard in March 2023 and subsequently rebranded as Gemini in 2024.20\\n\\nGoogle has rapidly iterated on the Gemini family, introducing several key model releases. Gemini 1.5, launched in February 2024, was a pivotal release, introducing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach to its architecture and a substantial 1-million-token context window.19 Subsequent advancements include Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental in December 2024, followed by Gemini 2.0 Flash becoming the default model in January 2025. Gemini 2.0 Pro was released in February 2025, with Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental following in March 2025. The Gemini 2.5 Flash became the default model in May 2025, and the highly cost-efficient Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite was released in June 2025.19\\n\\nA defining characteristic of the Gemini family is its native multimodality. These models are designed from the ground up to process and understand various types of data, including text, images, audio, video, and computer source code.18 This integrated multimodal capability enables a broader range of applications and a more holistic understanding of complex inputs. A notable advancement in the Gemini 2.5 models is their “thinking capabilities.” These models can reason through intermediate steps before generating a final response, leading to enhanced performance and improved accuracy.19 This internal thought process can even be observed in some models, providing greater transparency into their decision-making.24\\n\\nGemini is also deeply integrated across Google’s extensive ecosystem. It is woven into core Google products such as the search engine, advertising platforms, and the Chrome browser.18 Furthermore, its capabilities extend to Google Workspace applications like Gmail, Docs, and Sheets, as well as upcoming integrations in Android Auto and Google TV.22 This pervasive integration aims to enhance productivity and user experience across Google’s vast suite of services.\\n\\n**3. Technical Architecture and Specifications**\\n\\nThis section delves into the foundational technical aspects of each model, from their core design principles to the computational demands for their operation.\\n\\n**3.1. Core Design Principles**\\n\\nThe architectural underpinnings of these leading AI models reveal diverse strategies for achieving advanced capabilities.\\n\\nGrok 3:\\n\\nGrok 3 employs a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, estimated to have between 1.2 trillion and 2.7 trillion parameters.1 This design incorporates 128 expert networks with dynamic routing, allowing for specialized processing tailored to different task types while maintaining an impressive 83% parameter activation efficiency.25 A unique innovation in Grok 3 is the introduction of cross-expert attention gates, which facilitate knowledge sharing between these specialized components without detrimental interference.25 The model integrates transformer-based language modeling with symbolic reasoning modules, aiming for a hybrid approach to intelligence.25 Its unified embedding space is designed to accept a wide array of input modalities, including text in 45 languages, images up to 8K resolution, audio at 96kHz sampling, and 3D point clouds.25\\n\\nOpenAI’s GPT-4o:\\n\\nGPT-4o is built upon the well-established transformer architecture, primarily utilizing decoder layers. These layers incorporate self-attention mechanisms and positional encoding, which are crucial for the model to understand the order of words and their contextual relationships within a sequence.26 The model is estimated to possess 1.8 trillion parameters distributed across 120 neural network layers.27 GPT-4o operates on an autoregressive principle, meaning it predicts each new piece of content — whether text, image pixels, or sound — based on the information that precedes it.27 Its predecessor, GPT-4, also adopted a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, comprising 16 expert models, where approximately 280 billion parameters are actively utilized per query during inference.28 GPT-4o is described as a “unified model approach,” suggesting a more streamlined integration of its multimodal capabilities compared to previous separate pipelines.28\\n\\nGoogle’s Gemini:\\n\\nThe technical architecture of the Gemini family is rooted in Transformer decoders, which have been specifically optimized for high scalability and efficient inference when deployed on Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).18 A significant architectural shift occurred with Gemini 1.5, which notably introduced a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach to its design.19 While older Gemini versions supported a context length of 32,000 tokens 18, later iterations like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash have expanded this capacity to 1 million tokens, with plans for further expansion to 2 million tokens.21 Gemini also incorporates efficient attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input text without consuming excessive computational resources.18\\n\\n**3.2. Training Methodologies and Data Scale**\\n\\nThe scale and diversity of training data, coupled with sophisticated methodologies, are fundamental to the capabilities of these advanced LLMs.\\n\\nGrok 3:\\n\\nGrok 3 was trained on a colossal dataset of 13.4 trillion tokens.25 This extensive corpus is composed of a diverse mix: 32% from scientific literature, 41% from web documents, and 27% from curated dialogue datasets.25 A notable portion, 18%, consists of non-English content, primarily focused on STEM fields, indicating a strategic effort to enhance its scientific and technical understanding across languages.25 Grok 3 employs a real-time training paradigm, where its data is continuously updated until February 2025, drawing from public internet repositories and the X platform.1 This dynamic training approach allows it to stay current with evolving information. Furthermore, its multi-modal learning methodology enables it to process text, code, and images, thereby enhancing its comprehension and generation across various data formats.1\\n\\nOpenAI’s GPT-4o:\\n\\nOpenAI’s models, including GPT-4o, undergo extensive training on vast and diverse datasets. These datasets encompass a wide range of content, including text from books, articles, and websites, code from programming repositories, and millions of visual and audio recordings.26 The training process typically involves an initial pre-training phase on a broad corpus to allow the model to learn general language patterns and knowledge.26 This is followed by a fine-tuning stage on specific datasets, which adapts the model to perform better in specialized domains or tasks.26 For instance, GPT-4, the predecessor to GPT-4o, reportedly utilized approximately 13 trillion tokens during its training.28\\n\\nGoogle’s Gemini:\\n\\nGemini models are pre-trained on a variety of data sourced from publicly available resources.30 During this process, Google applies rigorous quality and safety filters, utilizing both heuristic rules and model-based classifiers to ensure data integrity.30 The training methodology for Gemini involves a staged approach, where the composition of the data mixture is altered during the training process. This includes increasing the weight of domain-relevant data towards the end of training to refine the model’s expertise in specific areas.30 Google acknowledges the critical importance of data quality in developing highly performing models, continually exploring optimal dataset distributions for pre-training.30\\n\\n**3.3. Hardware Requirements (Training & Inference)**\\n\\nThe computational demands for training and deploying these advanced LLMs are substantial, often requiring specialized hardware.\\n\\nGrok 3:\\n\\nFor training, Grok 3 was developed on the Colossus Supercluster, which harnesses the power of 100,000 to 200,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs.4 This massive scale of computational power is indicative of the resources required for frontier AI model development.\\n\\nFor **inference** (local/on-premise deployment), the minimum requirements for Grok 3 include a 64-bit Intel/AMD CPU, 16 GB of RAM, an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (such as an RTX 3080 or equivalent with 10+ GB VRAM), and 50 GB of SSD storage, running on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+).31 Recommended specifications for better performance escalate to a high-end multi-core processor (Intel i7/Ryzen 7 or better), 32 GB of RAM or higher, an NVIDIA RTX 3080 or equivalent with 12+ GB VRAM, and a 256 GB NVMe SSD.31 For optimal performance, particularly in enterprise-level AI workloads, 24 GB to 48 GB of VRAM is suggested, ideally with the latest generation NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 4000 series or professional A-series).33 The NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB GDDR6X) is considered a sweet spot for consumer-grade performance, offering sufficient power and VRAM for most Grok-1 workloads. For serious AI researchers and large-scale enterprise deployments, the NVIDIA A100 (40GB/80GB HBM2) remains an unparalleled choice.33\\n\\nFor **cloud-based deployment**, recommended configurations include:\\n\\nOpenAI’s GPT-4o:\\n\\nThe training of GPT-4, the foundational model for GPT-4o, required substantial computational resources. Estimates suggest the use of around 25,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs over a period of 90 to 100 days.28 OpenAI collaborated with Azure to co-design a supercomputer specifically to support this intensive training process.28 For **inference**, GPT-4 operates on clusters of 128 A100 GPUs.28 GPT-4o itself is noted for being significantly more efficient than its predecessor.16 For **general LLM inference locally**, which would apply to models like GPT-4o if made available for such deployment, a powerful GPU with sufficient VRAM is crucial. This includes options like the NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090 with 24GB VRAM. Ample RAM, typically 64 GB to 128 GB or more (DDR4/DDR5), is recommended for handling large models and datasets. Fast storage, such as an NVMe SSD (1TB+), is essential for quick model and data loading. A multi-core CPU, such as an AMD Ryzen Threadripper, Intel Xeon, Intel Core i9, or AMD Ryzen 9, is needed for data preprocessing and I/O operations. Finally, a robust power supply of 1000W or more is necessary to support high-performance GPUs.35\\n\\nGoogle’s Gemini:\\n\\nGemini models are optimized for execution on Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) during training.18 For **inference**, particularly with the Gemma models (which represent Google’s open models built on similar technology), specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs is generally required for effective performance. However, certain AI execution frameworks, such as Ollama and Gemma.cpp, enable these models to run on more common CPUs using x86-compatible or ARM architectures.37\\n\\nGemma 3 models are offered in various parameter sizes and precision levels, including full 32-bit, BF16 (16-bit), SFP8 (8-bit), Q4\\\\_0 (4-bit), and INT4 (4-bit quantization).38 These quantization levels significantly impact VRAM requirements. For instance, the Gemma 3 1B model (text-only) can run with as little as 861 MB of VRAM using INT4 quantization, while the larger Gemma 3 27B model requires 19.9 GB of VRAM in INT4.38 It is important to note that memory consumption increases based on the total number of tokens in the prompt, and fine-tuning these models demands significantly higher memory than inference.38\\n\\nThe hardware requirements for these models reveal distinct strategies for accessibility and performance. Grok 3 and OpenAI’s GPT-4o emphasize high-end, data-center-grade NVIDIA GPUs (H100, A100) for both training and optimal inference. This focus on raw computational power suggests a primary orientation towards cloud-based enterprise deployments and achieving cutting-edge performance. This approach, while pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities, can limit the feasibility of local deployment for many users due to the substantial hardware investment required.\\n\\nIn contrast, Google, particularly with its Gemma models, offers various parameter sizes and quantization levels (e.g., 4-bit INT4). This design choice drastically reduces VRAM requirements, enabling the execution of models on more common consumer-grade GPUs and even CPUs. This difference in approach indicates varying market targets. Google’s strategy with Gemma aims for broader accessibility, potentially fostering a larger ecosystem of local and on-device AI applications, which appeals to developers and smaller businesses with more limited high-end infrastructure budgets. This highlights a fundamental trade-off in the AI landscape between achieving absolute peak performance and ensuring wide accessibility.\\n\\n![]()\\n![]()\\n\\n**3.4. Sampling Strategies and Developer Control**\\n\\nSampling strategies are crucial parameters that empower developers to fine-tune the randomness and diversity of a model’s generated output. Common parameters include Temperature, Top-K, and Top-P, each offering a distinct mechanism for influencing text generation.40\\n\\nGrok 3:\\n\\nGrok 3 offers a suite of API control parameters to manage output generation. These include temperature, which ranges from 0 to 2, influencing the level of randomness in the generated text; top\\\\_p, a nucleus sampling probability mass ranging from 0 to 1; frequency penalty, which can be set from -2 to 2 to penalize frequently appearing tokens; and presence penalty, also from -2 to 2, to encourage the generation of new tokens.44 A unique feature for user control is the “Reasoning Slider.” This allows users to customize the AI’s cognitive effort, effectively balancing the speed of response with the depth of the model’s thought process. This slider dynamically allocates resources to optimize Grok 3’s advanced reasoning capabilities for specific tasks.4 Notably, the top\\\\_k parameter is not explicitly available or mentioned in the provided API documentation for Grok 3.44\\n\\nOpenAI’s GPT-4o:\\n\\nOpenAI’s GPT-4o provides temperature (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0) and top\\\\_p as its primary controls for managing the randomness and diversity of responses.41 A key distinction of OpenAI models, including GPT-4o, is that the Top-K sampling parameter is explicitly *not available*.41 OpenAI’s API reference generally advises developers to adjust either temperature or top\\\\_p, but not both simultaneously, to prevent unpredictable or inconsistent results in the generated output.41 This recommendation simplifies the tuning process for developers, guiding them towards a more focused approach to controlling model behavior.\\n\\nGoogle’s Gemini:\\n\\nGoogle’s Gemini models offer a comprehensive set of sampling parameters, providing granular control over output generation. These include temperature, which controls the degree of randomness (from 0 for deterministic outputs to higher values for more creativity) 42; topK, which limits token selection to the top K most probable tokens 42; topP, which selects tokens based on a cumulative probability threshold 42; max output tokens, to limit response length; and stop\\\\_sequences, to define specific strings that halt generation.42 Beyond these traditional parameters, Gemini’s “thinking capabilities” allow developers to observe the model’s internal thought process as it constructs responses.24 This provides a unique form of control and transparency into its decision-making. Furthermore, Gemini features “adaptive controls” and “adjustable thinking budgets,” which enable developers to manage resource usage and balance performance with cost, offering fine-grained control over the model’s reasoning process.48\\n\\nThe models exhibit different design philosophies regarding developer control over output generation. Grok 3 provides a more abstracted, high-level “Reasoning Slider” for dynamic resource allocation, which simplifies dynamic adjustments but may obscure some underlying probabilistic controls. OpenAI, by intentionally omitting top-k and recommending the use of either temperature or top\\\\_p but not both, focuses on ease of use and aims to prevent common misconfigurations that could lead to suboptimal or unpredictable outputs. This approach prioritizes a streamlined developer experience. Conversely, Gemini offers a full suite of granular probabilistic controls (temperature, topK, topP) alongside unique features like “thinking budgets” and “adaptive controls.” This indicates a preference for maximizing developer flexibility and providing transparency into the model’s internal reasoning process.\\n\\nThis divergence in control mechanisms impacts developer experience and the suitability of each model for specific applications. Developers who require precise, low-level control over token selection for highly sensitive or specialized outputs, such as generating legal text or synthesizing scientific data, might find Gemini’s extensive parameters more advantageous. This level of control allows for meticulous fine-tuning to ensure adherence to strict requirements. Conversely, those seeking a more streamlined and intuitive experience for general-purpose creative tasks or dynamic adjustments to reasoning effort may find Grok’s or OpenAI’s approaches more appealing. The trend across the industry appears to be a continuous effort to balance empowering developers with robust controls while simultaneously simplifying the complex task of AI tuning.\\n\\n**Table 2: Comparative Sampling Parameters and Control**\\n\\n![]()\\n![]()\\n\\n**4.

However, there is often confusion about what these models actually are, how they operate, and how they should be compared. For example, some discussions incorrectly compare GitHub Copilot with models like Gemini or GPT-4, when in reality, they serve fundamentally different purposes.\\n\\nThis article aims to clarify the distinctions between AI engines (such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta), the models they create, and the specific problems each category of AI is designed to solve. We will also break down the existing AI models into categories and highlight their primary applications and developers.\\n\\n# 1. What Are AI Engines?\\n\\nAI engines refer to the organizations or frameworks that develop, train, and deploy AI models. They provide the underlying architectures and computational power to make AI systems function. Some of the most well-known AI engines include:\\n\\n# 2. AI Models vs. AI Engines\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n# What’s the Difference?\\n\\nAI engines are the foundational frameworks that host, train, and run AI models. In contrast, AI models are the trained algorithms that interact with user inputs to generate responses, analyze data, or perform tasks. A model is a software-based entity, while an engine is a larger ecosystem that includes infrastructure, API access, deployment mechanisms, and computational power.\\n\\n# How Do AI Models Interact With Engines?\\n\\nAI models depend on engines for processing, training, and real-time execution. The interaction between AI models and engines happens in several stages:\\n\\n# AI Tools and Their Collaboration With Engines\\n\\nAI-powered tools and applications leverage AI engines to provide functionalities. Some key examples include:\\n\\nWhile Microsoft has marketed its **Copilot products** as independent AI systems, they are heavily reliant on OpenAI models running on Microsoft’s Azure AI infrastructure. This has led to confusion where users assume that Copilot is a standalone AI engine rather than a front-end tool that calls models via APIs. For example, in [Microsoft’s blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/), the terminology used suggests that Copilot is an independent AI, when in reality, it is a service built on OpenAI’s LLMs.\\n\\n# 3. Categories of AI Models\\n\\nAI models can be divided into several categories based on their functionality and objectives.\\n\\n# A. Large Language Models (LLMs)\\n\\nThese models specialize in understanding and generating human-like text.\\n\\n# B. Code Generation Models\\n\\nDesigned to assist with programming and software development.\\n\\n# C. Image Generation Models\\n\\nThese models convert text prompts into images.\\n\\n# D. Speech & Audio Models\\n\\nSpecialized in speech recognition and generation.\\n\\n# E. Multimodal AI Models\\n\\nThese models handle multiple types of input, including text, images, and audio.\\n\\n# F. Reinforcement Learning Models\\n\\nUsed for decision-making and autonomous learning.\\n\\n# G. Scientific & Specialized AI Models\\n\\nDesigned for solving specific industry problems.\\n\\n# 4. References\\n\\nTo ensure accuracy and reliability, the following sources were used to compile this article:\\n\\n# 5. Conclusion\\n\\nUnderstanding the distinction between AI models and AI engines is crucial for making informed comparisons and leveraging AI effectively. Each AI model is designed with a unique purpose, and AI engines facilitate their deployment and interaction within various applications. By recognizing these differences, we can foster better discussions around AI advancements and their impact on various industries.\\n\\n--\\n\\n--\\n\\n1\\n\\n![Moe Mollaie](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*il-agtqmbdHzF_o96gMdMQ.jpeg)\\n![Moe Mollaie](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*il-agtqmbdHzF_o96gMdMQ.jpeg)\\n\\n## Written by Moe Mollaie\\n\\nTech Principal | Software architect | Team Lead\\n\\n## Responses (1)\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nStatus\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nPress\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nPrivacy\\n\\nRules\\n\\nTerms\\n\\nText to speech\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 8: OpenAI vs. Microsoft: Is the AI Industry Facing a Reality Check? ---\\nURL: https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/openai-vs-microsoft-is-the-ai-industry-facing-a-reality-check-c8edb6c06bb7\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nAs OpenAI pushes for even more computing power, Microsoft is pulling back, concerned about overinvestment in AI infrastructure.\\n\\nFULL CONTENT:\\nSign up\\n\\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fdata-and-beyond%2Fopenai-vs-microsoft-is-the-ai-industry-facing-a-reality-check-c8edb6c06bb7&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n\\nSign up\\n\\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fdata-and-beyond%2Fopenai-vs-microsoft-is-the-ai-industry-facing-a-reality-check-c8edb6c06bb7&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png)\\n\\n## Data And Beyond\\n\\n![Data And Beyond](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*IF93zn_C1M65D2ddoMiwiA.jpeg)\\n\\nSelected stories around Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Programming, and Technology topics.

Each architecture functions differently and serves distinct purposes, making them relevant for various applications.\\n\\nTraditional machine learning relies on algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, which excel at problems with structured data and require considerable feature engineering. Developers often need to manually select features to input into these models, which makes traditional methods less scalable for complex tasks requiring pattern recognition from raw data [1](https://theceoviews.com/comparing-deep-learning-and-traditional-machine-learning/) [2](https://shelf.io/blog/choose-your-ai-weapon-deep-learning-or-traditional-machine-learning/).\\n\\nIn contrast, deep learning utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to automatically extract relevant features without manual input. This architecture shines in processing unstructured data, such as images and text, making it a go-to choice for applications like speech recognition and medical image analysis.

Learning](https://theceoviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Comparing-Deep-Learning-and-Traditional-Machine-Learning.webp)\\n\\nMachine learning is changing the way we live and revolutionizing a lot of industries. There are two main approaches to machine learning: traditional machine learning and deep learning. They are both good and bad and are good for different things. This article provides an in-depth comparison of these two machine-learning approaches to help businesses and startups understand which technique works best for their needs.\\n\\n## A Brief History\\n\\nLet’s first briefly trace the history of these two approaches.\\n\\n### The Evolution of Traditional Machine Learning\\n\\nResearch on machine learning originates in the late 1950s. Early on, machine learning concentrated on symbolic methods and statistical models like linear regression, support vector machines, Naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, etc. Hand-made elements were created by researchers to teach models particular tasks. Later terms for this type of machine learning were conventional or classical machine learning.\\n\\nThough useful, these classical models had limited powers. Creating hand-engineered features lacked scalability across jobs and demanded domain knowledge. Conventional ML models only could address limited, pre-defined issues.\\n\\n### The Advent of Deep Learning\\n\\nIn 2006, Geoffrey Hinton showed dramatically improved object recognition performance using a multilayer neural network trained in a novel way. This work revived interest in neural networks, which then saw rapid progress.\\n\\nDeep learning is the reference to contemporary neural networks with several hidden layers. Deep learning models replace hand feature engineering by automatically learning feature representations required for detection or classification. Leading deep learning development firms like Artjoker assist businesses in using these potent technologies for practical purposes: <https://artjoker.net/services/deep-learning-development-company/>.\\xa0\\n\\nIn 2012, Hinton and his colleagues developed a deep learning model called AlexNet that won the challenging ImageNet image classification competition by a huge margin over classical ML models. This established deep learning as a revolutionary approach for machine perception tasks.\\n\\n## Fundamental Differences\\n\\nWhile both approaches can solve a wide variety of ML problems like classification, object detection, language translation etc., they fundamentally differ in the following aspects:\\n\\n### 1. Feature Engineering\\n\\nA major difference is deep learning algorithms perform automatic feature extraction, while traditional machine learning relies on manual feature engineering.\\n\\nDeep learning models automatically identify and extract the most useful patterns from raw data to perform the task. For example, a convolutional neural network trained on images learns low-level edges, shapes, and texture patterns in initial layers. Further layers combine them into high-level features like face shapes to perform recognition.\\n\\nIn contrast, traditional ML models need humans to manually engineer input features based on their understanding of the problem. For example, for fraud detection, a data scientist extracts features like age, transaction amount, past suspensions etc., as inputs. Feature engineering requires domain expertise.\\n\\n### 2. Data Dependency\\n\\nTraditional ML models often work with small, clean datasets and do not always improve significantly with more data. In contrast, deep learning models are extremely data-hungry, and their performance improves as dataset size increases.\\n\\nToday, deep learning models’ image and speech recognition capabilities are mainly fueled by the availability of large annotated datasets like ImageNet, MS-COCO, etc., and the growth of big data and computing capabilities.\\n\\nDeep learning really shines when you feed more data to the algorithms. That said, traditional ML works better when less (but clean) data is available.\\n\\n### 3. Interpretability\\n\\nAnother major difference is that traditional machine learning models are interpretable, while deep neural networks are largely black boxes.\\n\\nFor example, a decision tree model splits the data based on if-then-else rules at each node. Humans can understand and interpret such clear decision boundaries. In contrast, parameters in a deep neural network are not intuitive or easily explainable.\\n\\nWhile research in interpretable AI and model explanations aims to open the black box, traditional ML still scores better on interpretability and transparency. This explainability is crucial for several applications.\\n\\n### 4. Hardware Dependence\\n\\nTraditional machine-learning algorithms run efficiently on standard [CPUs](https://www.britannica.com/technology/central-processing-unit). Deep networks require specialized hardware, such as [GPUs and TPUs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gpus-vs-tpus-comprehensive-comparison-neural-network-workloads-joel), for model training and inference.\\n\\nDeep learning relies on matrix multiplications and numerical computations, which are faster on GPUs than sequential operations on CPUs. Large deep nets cannot be trained without leveraging GPU acceleration.\\n\\n## Strengths and Limitations\\n\\nNow that you have seen how these techniques differ let’s look at their relative strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n### Traditional Machine Learning\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n**Limitations:**\\n\\n### Deep Learning\\n\\nStrengths:\\n\\nLimitations:\\n\\nAs you can see, both strategies have some complementing advantages. Deep learning gives performance; traditional ML offers openness.\\n\\n## Real-world Applications\\n\\nNow let us look at some real world applications of each approach after looking at their characteristics.\\n\\n### Traditional ML Applications\\n\\nMany critical applications powered by traditional machine learning rely on explainability.\\n\\n### Deep Learning Applications\\n\\nThanks to its exceptional perceptual skills, deep learning powers current real-world artificial intelligence technologies.\\n\\nDeep learning shines in perception-related tasks with uncertainty, like pictures, voice and language, as you saw. Analytical jobs involving structured data benefit from traditional machine learning.\\n\\n## Should You Use Traditional ML or Deep Learning?\\n\\nAfter weighing their pros and cons, here is guidance on when to use traditional ML vs deep learning:\\n\\n**When to adopt Traditional ML:**\\n\\n**When to embrace Deep Learning:**\\n\\nFor most real-world applications today, practitioners take a hybrid approach, using deep learning for perception and traditional ML for analytical tasks.\\n\\n## The Future Outlook\\n\\nIn recent years, great progress has been made in making deep learning models more interpretable, faster to train, and more efficient to run. At the same time, traditional ML also continues to evolve with advances like automated feature learning.\\n\\nWe are likely to see the convergence of these approaches in the future. Some promising research directions include:\\n\\nDeep learning and traditional ML have evolved over decades of research to reach today’s critical capabilities. Both approaches continue to co-evolve and borrow strengths from each other for the next generation of intelligent systems.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTraditional machine learning and deep learning have developed as complimentary approaches for artificial intelligence. For many analytical uses, openness and efficiency provided by traditional ML are absolutely vital. Deep learning offers state-of–the-art performance on contemporary perception problems by learning from big datasets. These methods will probably converge going ahead; deep learning will become more interpretable while classical ML will incorporate automated feature learning.\\n\\n![The Rise of UAE Flats for

Complex Pattern Recognition: For problems involving highly complex and non-linear relationships in high-dimensional data, deep learning can learn powerful feature representations and discover intricate patterns that traditional ML models may struggle with. Deep learning often surpasses traditional machine learning in tasks involving large-scale and complex data but comes with higher costs and resource needs. The choice between deep learning and traditional machine learning should be guided by a clear understanding of your specific project requirements, including the nature of the data, the complexity of the problem, and the available resources.\\n\\nFULL CONTENT:\\n![Choose Your AI Weapon: Deep Learning or Traditional Machine Learning: image 1](https://shelf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Seamlessly-Link-Structured-and-Unstructured-Data-with-a-Knowledge-Graph_4.jpg)\\n\\nWritten by [Jan Stihec](https://shelf.io/blog/author/jstihec/ \"Posts by Jan Stihec\")\\n\\n[Unstructured Data Management Platform](https://shelf.io/) » [AI Education](https://shelf.io/blog/category/ai-education/) » Choose Your AI Weapon: Deep Learning or Traditional Machine Learning\\n\\n# Choose Your AI Weapon: Deep Learning or Traditional Machine Learning\\n\\n![Choose Your AI Weapon: Deep Learning or Traditional Machine Learning: image 2](https://shelf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sidebar_cta_7-unexpected-causes-of-ai-hallucinations.png)\\n\\n## Traditional Machine Learning Explained\\n\\nTraditional machine learning focuses on building systems that can learn from and make accurate predictions based on data. This is characterized by the use of algorithms that are generally less complex than those used in deep learning, making them more interpretable and often requiring less computational power.\\n\\nThese algorithms also tend to excel when working with smaller datasets and can perform well without the need for high-end hardware like GPUs.\\n\\nHere are the key algorithms used in traditional machine learning:\\n\\nThese algorithms find applications across various fields. Decision Trees and SVM are frequently used in financial analysis for credit scoring and stock market predictions, while Logistic Regression is commonly applied in medical fields for disease diagnosis. Linear Regression is used in real estate to predict housing prices based on various features like size, location, and age of the property.\\n\\nThese traditional machine learning algorithms have been instrumental in advancing numerous industries by providing them with the tools to make informed decisions based on analyzing historical data patterns.\\n\\n## Deep Learning Explained\\n\\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning and a sophisticated branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that extends the capabilities of machine learning through models that are composed of multiple layers of [neural networks](https://shelf.io/blog/neural-networks-and-how-they-work-with-generative-ai/).\\n\\nAt the core of deep learning are neural networks that consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, each capable of performing specific computations. While the concept of neural networks is inspired by the biological neural networks found in the human brain, it’s important to note that the similarities are more thematic than literal. Artificial neural networks are engineered to process data in a manner that allows for pattern recognition and decision-making from large sets of [unstructured data](https://shelf.io), leveraging computational methods that differ significantly from the brain’s biological processes.\\n\\nBy adjusting the connections between these nodes during the training phase, a deep learning model can learn detailed and sophisticated data representations. This ability to automatically extract and learn features from raw data sets deep learning algorithms apart from more traditional techniques, which typically require manual feature extraction.\\n\\nDeep learning excels in many applications that involve large-scale and complex data such as images, sound, and text. It powers some of today’s advanced AI applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.\\n\\nFor instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition tasks to classify images with high accuracy, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants like LSTMs and GRUs are employed in processing sequential data such as language and time series.\\n\\nThe capability of deep learning algorithms to perform these complex tasks by learning from vast amounts of data has led to significant advancements in technology and science, making it a key technology in the push toward more intelligent and autonomous AI systems.\\n\\n## Comparing Deep Learning vs. Traditional Machine Learning\\n\\nLet’s walk through the main differences between deep learning and traditional machine learning models.\\n\\n### Data Requirements\\n\\nDeep learning requires vast amounts of data to effectively train its complex models, as it relies on large training datasets to learn and refine its understanding of features directly from the data.\\n\\nTraditional machine learning, in contrast, can often achieve good results with much smaller datasets. This is because traditional methods focus on utilizing statistical models to learn from data, and extensive feature engineering helps these models perform well even when data is limited.\\n\\nTherefore, the scale and availability of data can significantly influence the choice between using deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques.\\n\\n### Feature Engineering\\n\\nDeep learning significantly reduces the need for manual feature engineering, as it leverages its multiple layers to automatically extract and learn the relevant features from raw data. This capability is a major advantage in processing complex and high-dimensional data such as images or audio, where determining useful features manually would be impractical.\\n\\nIn contrast, traditional machine learning heavily relies on meticulous feature engineering to improve model accuracy. AI engineers must manually identify and select the most informative features from the data before training, which can be time-consuming and requires domain expertise, but is key to achieving good performance with simpler models.\\n\\n### Problem Complexity\\n\\nTraditional machine learning excels with structured, less complex problems where relationships between features are more straightforward, such as predicting housing prices or customer churn. These algorithms thrive on clear, numerical inputs and can efficiently model problems where the underlying patterns are not excessively intricate.\\n\\nOn the other hand, deep learning is particularly suited for tackling more complex issues that involve [unstructured data](https://shelf.io/blog/link-structured-and-unstructured-data-with-knowledge-graph/), like image and speech recognition, or natural language understanding.\\n\\nThese problems often feature hidden patterns and abstract relationships that are difficult for traditional models to capture without extensive feature engineering, making deep learning the better choice for handling high complexity.\\n\\n### Hardware Requirements\\n\\nTraditional machine learning models generally require less computational power, often running efficiently on standard CPUs. This makes them more accessible and cost-effective for many applications, particularly those involving smaller datasets or simpler algorithms.\\n\\nDeep learning models demand significantly more computational resources, typically requiring powerful GPUs or specialized hardware like TPUs to handle their intensive calculations.\\n\\nThis need for high-performance hardware stems from the large volumes of data and the complex computations involved in training deep neural networks, making deep learning more resource-intensive both in terms of energy and financial cost.\\n\\n### Interpretability\\n\\nTraditional machine learning models are generally easier to understand than deep learning models. Techniques like decision trees or linear regression allow users to easily understand how inputs are transformed into outputs, making it straightforward to explain decisions and results.\\n\\nThis transparency is crucial in fields like healthcare or finance, where understanding the decision-making process is as important as the accuracy of predictions.\\n\\nDeep learning models, on the other hand, are often considered “black boxes” because their numerous layers and complex structures obscure the logic behind their decisions. This lack of transparency can make it challenging to fully trust and validate the models’ behaviors and outputs.\\n\\n### Training Time\\n\\nTraining time varies significantly between traditional machine learning and deep learning due to their structural and computational differences.\\n\\nTraditional machine learning algorithms typically require less time to train, as they often work with smaller datasets and simpler models. This efficiency enables quicker iteration and deployment in practical applications.\\n\\nConversely, deep learning models, which consist of multiple layers and complex architectures, typically require greater training time on the same hardware. That said, with wide adoption of powerful GPUs, the training time is comparable to ML, but this increases the overall cost.\\n\\n### Software and Libraries\\n\\nTraditional machine learning is well-supported by libraries like scikit-learn, which provides tools for data mining and analysis, easily accessible for tasks involving regression, clustering, and classification using simpler algorithms.\\n\\nFor deep learning, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch dominate, offering extensive capabilities for building and training sophisticated neural networks.\\n\\nThese frameworks support automatic differentiation and are optimized for performance on GPU hardware, which allows for the development of complex models that are essential for tasks involving large-scale and high-dimensional data.\\n\\n### Human Intervention\\n\\nIn traditional machine learning, significant human involvement is necessary for tasks such as preprocessing data, selecting features, and tuning algorithms. This hands-on approach requires domain expertise and understanding of the data to guide the learning process effectively.\\n\\nDeep learning, however, automates many of these steps, especially feature extraction, reducing the need for manual intervention once the network architecture is defined. However, setting up deep learning models still requires expert knowledge to architect and tune neural networks, particularly in adjusting parameters and choosing the right layers to efficiently learn from data.\\n\\n## Deep Learning vs. Traditional Machine Learning Use Cases\\n\\nThe use cases for deep learning and traditional machine learning often differ significantly based on the nature of the problem, the complexity of data involved, and the expected outcomes. Understanding these distinctions can help you select the most appropriate approach for your specific needs.\\n\\n### Traditional Machine Learning Use Cases\\n\\nRisk Assessment: In finance, traditional machine learning algorithms like logistic regression are used to evaluate the risk profiles of loan applicants by analyzing historical data on creditworthiness and repayment history. This helps financial institutions decide whom to lend to and at what terms, minimizing the risk of defaults.\\n\\n**Customer Segmentation**: Traditional machine learning employs clustering techniques, such as k-means, to group customers based on similarities in their buying behaviors or demographics, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer service by targeting specific segments.\\n\\n**Spam Detection**: Simple classification algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, are effective at filtering out spam emails by learning to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails based on features like the frequency of certain words, sender information, and formatting details.\\n\\n**Predictive Maintenance**: Machine learning models, particularly regression algorithms, predict when industrial equipment or systems are likely to fail by analyzing operational data over time. This allows for maintenance to be scheduled before failures occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.\\n\\n**Real Estate Pricing**: Linear regression models are commonly utilized to estimate real estate prices, taking into account various attributes such as location, size, age, and condition of the property. This aids buyers and sellers in making informed decisions and ensuring fair transactions.\\n\\n### Deep Learning Use Cases\\n\\n**Image Recognition**: Deep learning excels in image recognition tasks through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are adept at processing pixel data to detect and classify objects within images. This technology underpins systems ranging from automated medical diagnosis to self-driving cars, where accurate image interpretation is crucial.\\n\\n**Speech Recognition**: Deep neural networks, especially Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells, are pivotal in translating spoken language into text. This technology is widely used in voice-activated assistants and real-time communication applications.\\n\\n**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques like Transformers and models such as BERT have revolutionized NLP, enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text. These models are used in a variety of applications, from automatic translation services to chatbots and sentiment analysis tools.\\n\\n**Advanced Game AI**: Deep learning models have been used to develop highly sophisticated AI that can learn and master complex game strategies, evident in systems like AlphaGo and OpenAI Five.

However, it comes with its own set of advantages and challenges.\\n\\n### Pros of Deep Learning\\n\\n### Cons of Deep Learning\\n\\n## Pros and Cons of Traditional Machine Learning\\n\\nTraditional machine learning has been foundational in the field of data science and artificial intelligence. While these methods offer several advantages, they also have limitations.\\n\\n### Pros of Traditional Machine Learning\\n\\n### Cons of Traditional Machine Learning\\n\\n## Choosing Between Deep Learning and Traditional Machine Learning\\n\\nThe decision between using deep learning or traditional machine learning isn’t about which technology is more powerful. It’s about which is more appropriate for your specific project. Consider the following factors to make your decision (and consider if a hybrid approach is useful).\\n\\n### Data Availability\\n\\nIf you have access to large datasets, deep learning might be the preferable option. For smaller datasets, traditional machine learning methods are often more effective and easier to deploy.\\n\\n### Complexity of the Problem\\n\\nDeep learning excels in handling unstructured data such as images, audio, and text, where the patterns may be highly intricate and non-linear. Traditional machine learning is often sufficient for simpler, structured data tasks where relationships between variables are more straightforward.\\n\\n### Computational Resources\\n\\nDeep learning models generally require more computational power, including GPUs and substantial memory, which can be costly. Traditional machine learning can usually be performed on standard computing systems without specialized hardware.\\n\\n### Expertise and Effort for Feature Engineering\\n\\nIf you have the domain knowledge necessary to perform extensive feature engineering, traditional machine learning might yield good results. If automating feature extraction and reducing human intervention is a priority, deep learning is advantageous.\\n\\n### Interpretability Requirements\\n\\nIf your application requires clear explanations of how decisions are made—for example, in industries like healthcare or finance—traditional machine learning is more suitable. Deep learning models, due to their “[black box](https://shelf.io/blog/ai-transparency-and-explainability/)” nature, are less suitable where transparency is needed.\\n\\n### Training Time\\n\\nConsider how much time you can allocate for training models. Deep learning models often require long training times, especially as model complexity and dataset sizes increase, whereas traditional machine learning models can be trained relatively quickly.\\n\\n### Performance Expectations\\n\\nFinally, consider the level of accuracy or performance you need. Deep learning often surpasses traditional machine learning in tasks involving large-scale and complex data but comes with higher costs and resource needs.\\n\\n## Choosing the Right Learning Model\\n\\nThe choice between deep learning and traditional machine learning should be guided by a clear understanding of your specific project requirements, including the nature of the data, the complexity of the problem, and the available resources. Both approaches offer valuable tools that can lead to successful outcomes when applied appropriately.\\n\\nAs you move forward, carefully consider the pros and cons of each method, and remain adaptable, ready to harness the right technology to effectively address the challenges and opportunities of your unique data science endeavors.\\n\\n## Read more from Shelf\\n\\n![Choose Your AI Weapon: Deep Learning or Traditional Machine Learning: image 3](https://shelf.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/the-transformation-of-knowledge-management-in-the-age-of-ai.png)\\n\\nWritten By [Danylo Pantielieiev](https://shelf.io/blog/author/danylo-pantielieievshelf-io/)\\n\\n### [The Transformation of Knowledge Management in the Age of AI](https://shelf.io/blog/ai-knowledge-management-transformation/)\\n\\nIntro: The Rise of AI and Automation The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly in the realm of generative AI, is ushering in a transformative era across various industries.

Generative AI can also recommend routine maintenance schedules.\\n\\n*   **Improve supply chain:**You could use generative AI to track down the cause of problems in the supply chain by speaking conversationally with the technology to sort through a vast amount of transactional or product data. Generative AI can also help generate delivery schedules or recommendations for suppliers.\\n\\n### 4. Software development\\n\\nFor a software development team, generative AI can provide tools to create and optimize code faster and with less experience using programming languages. A few examples of the applications of generative AI in software development include:\\n\\n*   **Generating code:**Software developers can create, optimize, and auto-complete code with generative AI. Generative AI can create code blocks by comparing them to a library of similar information. It can also predict the rest of the code a developer begins to type, much like how auto-complete works while texting on a smartphone.\\n\\n*   **Translate programming languages:**Generative AI can be a tool for developers to interact with software without needing a programming language. The generative AI would act as a translator.\\n\\n*   **Automate testing:**Developers can improve their automated testing processes using generative AI to highlight potential problems and execute testing sequences faster than other AI methods. Generative AI can learn the logic of the software and how users will interact with it, and create test cases to demonstrate various user scenarios.\\n\\n### 5. Financial services\\n\\nAccording to McKinsey, generative AI could add $200 billion to $340 billion of value to the banking industry annually [[2](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier)]. Some of the applications of generative AI in the financial services industry include artificial intelligence investment strategies, drafting documentation and monitoring regulatory changes, and using generative AI as an interpreter to facilitate communications between clients and investors.\\n\\n*   **Create investment strategies:** Generative AI can recommend the best investments according to your or your client’s goals. This technology can find and execute trades much faster than human investors and can do so within the parameters you set for the kind of transaction you want.\\n\\n*   **Communicate and educate clients and investors:** Financial services professionals sometimes need to communicate complex information to clients and colleagues. Generational AI can provide hyperpersonalized customer service without adding more customer service professionals.\\n\\n*   **Quickly draft documentation and monitor regulation:**Generative AI can monitor regulatory activity, keep you informed of any changes, and create drafts of documents such as investment research or insurance policies.\\n\\n### 6. Media and entertainment\\n\\nMedia and entertainment could embrace generative AI in several ways, considering the industry primarily engages in the same task as the tech: generating unique content. Generative AI can help create and edit visual content, create short highlight videos of sporting events, and make working with content management systems easier.\\n\\n*   **Create audio and visual content:** Generative AI can create new video content from scratch. This tech can also help you make visual content faster by creating visual effects, adding graphics, or streamlining editing.\\n\\n*   **Generate highlights for sports and events:**When it comes to sporting and live events, gen AI can create highlight reels instantly and allow fans to create their own custom highlights. For example, fans could generate highlights of a particular play or a tournament series.\\n\\n*   **Manage tags for better content management:** Generative AI can tag and index extensive media libraries, making locating the files you need at any time easier. Similar to our manufacturing example above, generative AI allows using conversational language to find the information or media you’re looking for in a complex media library.\\n\\n### What is one thing current generative AI applications cannot do\\u200b?\\n\\nWhile generative AI can assist with a variety of tasks, these algorithms don’t have true “human intelligence,” meaning they struggle with tackling [ethical dilemmas](https://www.coursera.org/articles/generative-ai-ethics) or making more strategic decisions for broader, less-defined challenges. The best uses of generative AI typically have a refined scope and clear directions, while human oversight is still needed for more nuanced decision-making.\\n\\n![Image 6](https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera_assets.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/purple-hash-pattern.svg?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&blur=200&px=8&max-w=252)\\n\\nHow to find solutions with generative AI\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you’re interested in bringing generative AI to your company, you can approach the technology in two ways. First, you can use existing models and learn to engineer prompts to your needs. Or, you can customize solutions to fit your business processes.\\n\\n*   **You can use existing generative AI tools like ChatGPT**. In this scenario, you’ll focus on learning how to write prompts that get the best answer possible from the technology. For example, you might identify who your audience is and the appropriate tone of the piece to help the application deliver the correct results.\\n\\n*   **You can integrate custom solutions from an enterprise-level company or build your own generative AI tools**. While it won’t be feasible or practical for many companies to create their own generative AI solutions, many generative AI companies offer solutions you can tailor to your business needs. Generative models will vary on features, cost, and security or privacy standards.\\n\\nLearn more with Coursera\\n------------------------\\n\\nIf you’re ready to take the next step and find generative AI applications for your company, consider taking a microlearning course.

Generative AI: Complete overview of the techniques and applications\\n\\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/612770618d97595db63a9470/6660789ab75ccb1fa3880f95_arrow-sm-left%201.svg)\\n\\n#### Contents\\n\\nChatGPT, DALL-E, what is next? OpenAI has done everything in its power to keep the entire tech community on its toes. Despite futile attempts by other tech giants to steal OpenAIâ\\x80\\x99s thunder, it kept bringing on new waves of innovation, securing its spot as the leading advocate for AI research. Of course, the growing similarity between emerging technologies leaves us wondering: *What do these state-of-the-art tools have in common?* The answer is right there: the most stunning advancements in artificial intelligence are largely attributed to [generative AI](https://www.superannotate.com/llms)â\\x80\\x94 a technology that can create new content from scratch, whether AI-generated art, images, text, or audio files. Fortunately for us, the technology is not as complicated as it sounds; with generative AI, a model studies and identifies patterns that are connected to the input to produce similar content. However, with each passing day, these models are evolving and learning further based on their mistakes, which begs the question: *How much more are they capable of with continuous training?*â\\x80\\x8d\\n\\nIn this blog post, we will be covering generative AI from A-Z, highlighting why you and your industry should or should not adopt it.\\n\\n## A brief overview of generative AI and how it emerged\\n\\nGenerative AIâ\\x80\\x99s abilities go beyond fun mobile applications and avatars, as they are now being used to create art pieces and design, produce code, write blogs, and generate all kinds of different high-quality content.\\n\\nBy using unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms, generative AI processes enormous amounts of data to generate its own outputs. One example is how with [large language models](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/llm-overview), computer programs can now easily understand texts and generate new content. The [neural network](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/guide-to-neural-networks-and-deep-learning) that is at the core of generative AI can pick up on the traits of a specific image or text and then exert it when needed.\\n\\nThrough generative AI, computers can predict the most relevant patterns to input, allowing them to output corresponding content. During the training, a limited number of parameters are given to the generative AI models, enabling them to make their own conclusions and highlight features present in the training data. However, to get the most out of generative AI, human involvement is still essential, and that is both at the start and end of the training.\\n\\n![generative ai](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c82ed388d53640613982e/66fab9a0b468f7e5d60b234d_63f8af27090108693673f6aa_generative%2520ai.jpeg)\\n\\n## Applications of generative AI\\n\\nNow that we have summed up how generative AI works letâ\\x80\\x99s take a look at some of its most-used applications.\\n\\n### Arts\\n\\nGenerative AI is frequently utilized in creative sectors, specifically to create art and generate images. In fact, [AI-generated visuals](https://www.veed.io/tools/ai-image-generator) are a whole new category of art nowadays. These models can be trained on a large number of paintings and later be used to generate new ones with similar features and slight variations in style.\\n\\nFor example, if you want your AI to produce works similar to Leonardo Da Vinci, you will need to provide it with as many paintings of Da Vinci as possible. Once that is done, the modelâ\\x80\\x99s neural network observes and takes in the characteristics of those art pieces to reproduce similar works. The same goes for models that generate text, produce music, etc. With generative AI, another feature you get is changing one kind of image into another, meaning modifying the style or specific areas of the image. This occurs when the generative AI model copies the characteristics and aesthetic of your preferred painting and gives you an alternative version. It can also work with rough sketches or wireframes and offer a finalized version of the design.\\n\\n![generative ai in arts](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c82ed388d53640613982e/66fab9a0b468f7e5d60b235d_63f8b107abc1a23dd2d5c646_applications%2520of%2520generative%2520ai%2520scenario.jpeg)\\n\\n### Gaming\\n\\nVideo games are benefiting from generative AI through its generation of new levels, dialogue options, maps, and new virtual worlds. Generative AI can provide new experiences for players by building immersive worlds for them to explore, like cities, forests, and even new planets. One example is [Scenario](https://www.scenario.gg/) which allows game developers to train their generators to produce images according to the particular model of their games. Generative AIâ\\x80\\x99s intervention could lead to an increase in the number of games that are created annually, which also means new genres that would not have been invented without the help of generative AI.\\n\\n### Image instance creation\\n\\nGenerative AI is perhaps best known for its ability to produce fake realistic-looking photographs of people. When the input data is an image of someoneâ\\x80\\x99s face, the model gets trained on it and then generates fake images/photographs with the same faces.\\n\\n### Healthcare\\n\\nWith generative AI models, healthcare professionals can identify health issues early on and get to create treatments on time. Generative AI is also being used in healthcare applications for its ability to revert MRI scans into CT scans. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are also learning to create fake versions of underrepresented data, which is later used in training and developing a model. They are also handy for identifying data and improving its privacy and security.\\n\\n### Sound generation\\n\\nGenerative AI can even work with audio data, altering the sound of musical genres or human voices. With its intervention, a musical piece can be transformed from one genre to another, for example, rock into classical music, and vice-versa. [Musico](http://musi-co.com) is an example of an AI-driven software engine that generates music, making use of gestures, motions, codes, and much more. Musico\\'s engines have the ability to create according to the userâ\\x80\\x99s preferences, and that varies from musical sketches to full songs.\\n\\n### Copywriting\\n\\nThe ever-growing demand for personalized web and email content for marketing purposes is a reason enough for having more automated solutions. When it comes to writing, more specifically copywriting, it seems like generative AI has a lot to offer. By teaching generative AI algorithms to grasp the main ideas and look for keywords, copywriters can now create better headlines and make sure to grab the readersâ\\x80\\x99 attention. Generative AIâ\\x80\\x99s ability to generate content can improve your work, help you explain concepts more efficiently, and help you come up with new ways to produce higher-quality writing. Despite speculations on how generative AI is taking over industries such as copywriting, when looking at it from up close, one can see that they are nothing more than mere assistants for humans, making sure their works reach their full potential. An example is [Copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/), a generative AI that can create blogs with optimized texts, social media posts with high conversion rates, and engaging emails from scratch. Furthermore, such tools can take care of the itty bitty aspects of copywriting, such as repetitive tasks, bullet lists, and subheadings, and leave the creative aspect of it to humans.\\n\\n### Media and advertising\\n\\nGenerative AI can modify content creation through super-resolution. In the media industry, combining machine learning techniques with marketing techniques can lead to improved content generation. Predictive targeting is an example of a marketing technique that utilizes both AI and [machine learning](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/machine-learning-computer-vision-terms), foreseeing a customerâ\\x80\\x99s next decision by analyzing their old data and behavior patterns. [Synthesia](http://synthesia.io) is another example of a well-known generative AI company that implements new synthetic media technology for visual content creation, and it does so by using minimum skills and cost. By utilizing generative AI, both marketing and advertising industries can produce more personalized content, they can better understand the market and consumer behavior, and come up with more efficient campaigns.\\n\\n### SuperAnnotate\\n\\nSuperAnnotateâ\\x80\\x99s [SuperGen](https://generate.superannotate.com/) feature is another example of generative AI. Our platform now also allows you to [generate synthetic data](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/llm-synthetic-data), which you can use as an addition to your existing datasets. All you need to do is log in, type out the desired prompt, and click submit.\\n\\n![superannotate platform](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c82ed388d53640613982e/66fab9a0b468f7e5d60b2358_63f8b139aff9d1053a7bbfb5_superannotate%2520platform.jpeg)\\n\\nIf you find any of the results applicable to your dataset, you can generate similar but by selecting the respective image and clicking the Generate *similar* button below.\\n\\n![superannotate supergen feature](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c82ed388d53640613982e/66fab9a0b468f7e5d60b2355_63f8b193ee44e3f567714cec_superannotate%2520supergen.jpeg)\\n\\nBy leveraging SuperGen, you can add diversity to your data and potentially minimize dataset bias before it goes to training.\\n\\n## How generative AI is governed\\n\\nWith the emergence of generative AI, we have also witnessed different approaches to AI governance. Within private sectors, there are two main approaches; the first is companies self-governing the space by limiting release strategies, keeping an eye out on the use of the models, and limiting access to their products. Newer organizations, on the other hand, believe that generative artificial intelligence models are for democratizing access as they have the potential to positively impact both the economy and human society.\\n\\nWhen looking at public sectors, there are no regulations concerning the growth of generative AI models, yet that does make more room for issues concerning the invasion of privacy, intellectual property, and copyright. As generative artificial intelligence datasets are usually retrieved from the internet, they are used without permission from the creators/artists, which can appear to be original when in reality, it is fabricated and can cause plagiarism.\\n\\n## Problems concerning generative AI\\n\\nAs beneficial as generative artificial intelligence gets, its growth does raise legal, moral, and ethical questions. Let\\'s have a look at some of the biggest concerns:\\n\\n### Copyright\\n\\nWith generative AI producing unlimited amounts of content, especially art pieces, the internet will shortly be filled with paintings that are unrecognizable from the original ones. This also raises the issue of it replacing humans when it comes to many creative workforces, such as freelancers or commercial artists who work in publishing, entertainment, and even advertising.\\n\\n### Unreliable content\\n\\nAs generative AI models are being fed large datasets such as articles, books, and websites, there is a huge chance that the information they are being given is biased, and that makes it hard to filter credible content completely. With this, models can easily create deep fakes, reinforce [machine learning bias](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/bias-in-machine-learning), and share misleading content across platforms.\\n\\n### Scams\\n\\nThe internet is filled with scammers and people who are trying to steal your data, and generative artificial intelligence can be used by such people to successfully cause damage to users or, at the very least, circulate spammy news online.\\n\\n![scams concerning generative ai](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/614c82ed388d53640613982e/66fab9a0b468f7e5d60b2350_63f8b1b7192bb11d8d738b89_scam.jpeg)\\n\\n### The need for large amounts of training data\\n\\nAs stated above, generative AI algorithms need large amounts of training data so they can perform their tasks with high accuracy. However, it is challenging for GANs to generate entirely new content; they can only combine what they picked up in new different ways and give a fresh output. With GANs being hard to control, generative artificial intelligence models are not always stable, and they can give out unexpected outcomes.\\n\\n## Benefits of generative AI\\n\\nThere has to be a reason for engineers to go gown the generative road and for users to love the end product, right? So, here are some of the advantages of generative artificial intelligence:\\n\\n### Robotic control\\n\\nGenerative modeling helps reinforcement machine learning models in exhibiting less bias. They also give these models the ability to grasp complex ideas.\\n\\n### Automated content variety\\n\\nGenerative AI can take in any type of content, whether text, image, video, code, etc. It can also give answers to questions and output new content, including translations, summaries, and analyses. This is a big time-saver for students and researchers, as they can access more content and information in less time.\\n\\n### Personalized content creation\\n\\nOnce generative AI models go through training, they can start producing personalized content upon their usersâ\\x80\\x99 preferences. This can benefit businesses in creating content that is more likely to reach their target audiences, as they are specifically tailored to their own preferences.\\n\\n## Generative AI techniques\\n\\nAs we covered earlier on, in order to produce content, generative artificial intelligence lets machines find the underlying pattern related to the input, and it does so through a few different techniques.\\n\\n## Future of generative AI\\n\\nWhen most of the AI systems we have today are used as classifiers, what distinguishes the generative AI apart is its ability to be creative and use that creativity to produce something new. Not only are generative AI tools revolutionizing the marketing and art industries, but their applications are becoming more and more practical in fields such as pharmaceuticals, medtech, and biotech, with many experts predicting the development of new solutions within the next few years. Generative AI is more than NLP tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and text generation, with OpenAIâ\\x80\\x99s ChatGPT as the biggest proof (reaching millions of users in just a few days).

from existing artifacts to generate new, realistic artifacts (at scale) that reflect the characteristics of the training data but don’t repeat it. It can produce a variety of novel content, such as images, video, music, speech, text, software code and product designs.\\n\\nGenerative AI uses a number of techniques that continue to evolve. Foremost are AI foundation models, which are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data that can be used for different tasks, with additional fine-tuning.Complex math and enormous computing power are required to create these trained models, but they are, in essence, [prediction algorithms](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/3-bold-and-actionable-predictions-for-the-future-of-genai).\\n\\nToday, generative AI most commonly creates content in response to natural language requests — it doesn’t require knowledge of or entering code — but the [enterprise use cases](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/topics/ai-strategy-for-business) are numerous and include innovations in drug and chip design and material science development. (Also see “[What are some practical uses of generative AI?](https://www.gartner.com/en/topics/generative-ai#q5)”)\\n\\n**Download Now:**[A Workbook for Planning Your GenAI Strategy](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/topics/ai-strategy-for-business)\\n\\n[](https://www.gartner.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/the-journey-to-generative-ai.png)\\n\\n[![Image 6: null](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/commonassets/fonts/gartnericons/icon-share-facebook.svg) Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/the-journey-to-generative-ai.png)[![Image 7: null](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/commonassets/fonts/gartnericons/icon-share-x.svg) Share on X](https://twitter.com/share?text=&url=https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/the-journey-to-generative-ai.png&via=Gartner_Inc)[![Image 8: null](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/commonassets/fonts/gartnericons/icon-share-linkedin.svg) Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/the-journey-to-generative-ai.png&title=&summary=The%20Journey%20to%20Generative%20AI&source=Gartner)[![Image 9: *](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/commonassets/fonts/gartnericons/icon-share-email.svg) Share by Email](mailto:?body=%0D%0Ahttps://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/the-journey-to-generative-ai.png)\\n\\n[![Image 10: The Journey to Generative AI](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/the-journey-to-generative-ai.png)](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/the-journey-to-generative-ai.png)\\n\\nWhat’s behind the sudden hype about generative AI?\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGartner has tracked generative AI on its [Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle)™ for [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.gartner.com/en/topics/artificial-intelligence) since 2020 (also, generative AI was among our Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2022), and the technology has moved from the Innovation Trigger phase to the Peak of Inflated Expectations. But generative AI only hit mainstream headlines in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of very human-seeming interactions.\\n\\n[ChatGPT](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/your-7-biggest-chatgpt-questions-answered), launched by OpenAI, became wildly popular overnight and galvanized public attention. (OpenAI’s DALL·E 2 tool similarly generates images from text in a related generative AI innovation.)\\n\\nGartner sees generative AI becoming a general-purpose technology with an impact similar to that of the steam engine, electricity and the internet. The hype will subside as the reality of implementation sets in, but the impact of generative AI will grow as people and enterprises discover more innovative applications for the technology in daily work and life.\\n\\n[FAQ on ChatGPT](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/topics/documents/gartner-addresses-frequently-asked-questions-on-chatgpt.pdf)\\n\\nWhat are the benefits and applications of generative AI?\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFoundation models, including generative pretrained transformers (which drives ChatGPT), are among the AI architecture innovations that can be used to automate, augment humans or machines, and autonomously execute business and IT processes.\\n\\nThe benefits of generative AI include faster product development, enhanced customer experience and improved employee productivity, but the specifics depend on the use case. End users should be realistic about the value they are looking to achieve, especially when using a service as is, which has major limitations. Generative AI creates artifacts that can be inaccurate or biased, making human validation essential and potentially limiting the time it saves workers. Gartner recommends connecting use cases to KPIs to ensure that any project either improves operational efficiency or creates net new revenue or better experiences.\\n\\nIn a recent Gartner webinar poll of more than 2,500 executives, 38% indicated that customer experience and retention is the primary purpose of their generative [AI investments](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/optimize-ai-investments-for-long-term-business-growth). This was followed by revenue growth (26%), cost optimization (17%) and business continuity (7%).\\n\\n[](https://www.gartner.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/primary-focus-of-generative-ai-initiatives.png)\\n\\n[![Image 11: null](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/commonassets/fonts/gartnericons/icon-share-facebook.svg) Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/primary-focus-of-generative-ai-initiatives.png)[![Image 12: null](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/commonassets/fonts/gartnericons/icon-share-x.svg) Share on X](https://twitter.com/share?text=&url=https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/primary-focus-of-generative-ai-initiatives.png&via=Gartner_Inc)[![Image 13: null](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/commonassets/fonts/gartnericons/icon-share-linkedin.svg) Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/social-images/primary-focus-of-generative-ai-initiatives.png&title=&summary=Primary%20Focus%20of%20Generative%20AI%20I\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 10: 2025 Guide to Generative AI: Techniques, Tools & Trends ---\\nURL: https://hatchworks.com/blog/gen-ai/generative-ai/\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nAt its core, gen AI is powered by deep learning algorithms that analyze vast amounts of data to make predictions, generate content, and even create new data. By proactively addressing these challenges, you can ensure the responsible and beneficial use of generative AI in your projects, leading to a more innovative, efficient, and ethical digital product development process. Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to create new data, content, or predictions based on existing data. Generative AI specifically focuses on the creation of new content by learning from existing data. How can generative AI improve product design and development?

AI Technologies and Realized and Anticipated Benefits by Case Study Application ................... 11 ATSSA.com | Page 1 Introduction Transportation agencies, along with private sector partners, are looking for new ways to inject innovation into management practices and processes. These stakeholders are challenged with the need to improve efficiencies using data from a variety of transportation elements and produce results that have a positive effect on safety and mobility. From planning, designing and constructing transportation projects to efficiently maintaining an aging infrastructure, agencies use electronic applications with large amounts of data for efficiency. However, the process can be complicated and sometimes overwhelming to assess and optimize. Fortunately, advanced technology in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) is available to transform the ways agencies consume and use data to support their missions. AI is technology that allows machines to think, learn and process data in much more efficient ways than traditional methods. Machine learning and fuzzy logic are examples of AI subsets, where these rule-based systems rely on the practical experience of the operator1. An example is a fuzzy logic ramp metering algorithm that uses rules to evaluate mainline freeway traffic flow to control vehicles entering from a nearby ramp to maintain acceptable conditions on the mainline. Machine learning has a more limited scope than AI overall. Both require human inputs to operate, and AI can learn and improve while processing large quantities of complex data. Practitioners see AI as an integral component in the paradigm shift from evaluating historical safety data to proactively saving lives through such technology applications. Application of AI falls into five macro-level categories: text AI, visual AI, interactive AI, analytical AI and functional AI. Text AI is available to the user in the most basic form. As an example, through a current open-source application named ChatGPT, users can type in a question or phrase and the AI technology provides a response that might take a human several hours of research to produce. GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, the technology that allows the tool to generate human-like text responses based on the input it receives. For example, when asked to define AI, ChatGPT2 provides the following explanation: Figure 1. ChatGPT Sample Output Format (Source: chat.openai.com) 1 https://www.controleng.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-fuzzy-logic-explained/ 2 https://chat.openai.com ATSSA.com | Page 2 In the more advanced stages, the application of AI to the transportation industry includes analysis of safety data, predictive techniques and decision-support tools. The results can positively affect decisions from assessing pavement markings to developing enhanced asset management programs to more efficient maintenance programs. As a result of research and prototype testing, agencies have asked several questions that help to consider the broader application of AI to transportation, including: • What if AI could predict when and where traffic incidents are most likely to occur? • Can AI be used to evaluate maintenance needs in place of time-consuming site reviews? • Does AI have both in-vehicle and roadside or roadway technology capabilities? • Is AI capable of running innovative pavement marking machines to maintain existing markings? • What types of data can AI use to help with infrastructure management and maintenance? • Can AI also communicate with in-vehicle technologies for a broader positive impact? • Could AI provide inputs to our team that help us save lives instead of reviewing lagging statistics after lives are lost? While some of these concepts are in the early development stages, and others are included in experimental activities and tests, some agencies are integrating AI into everyday practices. The following case studies explore ideas and concepts related to these questions and highlight how some agencies are implementing AI tools to improve transportation safety and more efficiently deliver programs. ATSSA.com | Page 3 Case Studies Iowa Department of Transportation: AI for Traffic Incident Management Iowa State University (ISU), in conjunction with the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT), is developing a deep learning-based system to improve detection and support decision-making for traffic incident management. Data consists of camera feeds and traffic sensor information at intervals of less than one minute. The system uses the TensorFlow deep learning framework to assess incidents using video image data, with a future focus on predicting problems based on traffic conditions. TensorFlow (tensorflow.org) open-source software is helping Iowa DOT understand overall traffic patterns to process large amounts of data and better understand how to optimize the transportation network. The research and development work are supported by a three-year Grant from the National Science Foundation. The system, known as Traffic Incident Management Enabled by Large-data Innovations (TIMELI), uses large-scale data analytics to reduce the number of incidents and minimize the impacts from incidents by shortening their exposure time. Using TensorFlow along with advanced graphics cards, the system analyzes existing Iowa DOT data streams to find incidents and will eventually predict problem areas. This will ultimately improve safety not only for motorists but also for incident response personnel. By shortening incident duration, the DOT can better manage non-recurring congestion and reduce the impacts from secondary crashes around the incident location. Data sources include high-definition camera feeds and traffic sensor data. AI can process the data just as a human would if humans had the ability to monitor video feeds in real-time for extended periods. As a specific case example, a traffic management center (TMC) operator has a video feed from Interstate 235 in Des Moines. The camera is facing east in the direction of a major route serving a local high school. Personnel in the TMC, which is staffed 24 hours a day, would normally observe growing congestion and would communicate with responders and post warnings to message signs once the incident is verified. This process could take a few minutes or longer. To compound the challenge, there could be multiple locations across the state with incidents occurring at the same time. While operators would only be able to process a finite amount of data and respond, AI can handle large quantities of data and process information and response for multiple incidents at the same time. AI also becomes “smarter” after processing video and detector data to determine the conditions on the roadway, thereby improving the response and possibly reaching a point of being able to predict when conditions are more conducive to incidents. This application provides for enhanced verification and response and by shortening the incident exposure time, secondary crashes can be reduced or avoided. Figure 2. Iowa DOT Traffic Camera Feed on I-235 in Des Moines (Source: Iowa DOT) ATSSA.com | Page 4 For the system to work, researchers are studying methods of identifying and classifying incidents. In uncongested conditions, a vehicle trajectory-based method works to identify an incident. However, individual vehicle trajectories become more difficult to track in congested conditions; therefore, a pixel-based approach3 works best in congested conditions. Researchers use YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) object detector algorithms to detect vehicles and then estimate optimum flow, use motion feature extraction, and use supervised motion feature classification. Researchers also evaluate the potential for active traffic management features based on mainline incidents, such as rerouting traffic to alternate routes and the effects on—or needs of—traffic signals along the alternate route. This approach included a preliminary study on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for adaptive signal control and traffic rerouting. This project resulted in the creation of system architecture, tools for processing large-scale data sets and analyzing results, and a prototype software package with documentation and a user manual. Researchers plan to provide these tools to TMC operators for integration into existing software systems to make use of AI for enhanced incident management. 3 TIMELI: Traffic Incident Management Enabled by Large-data Innovations (NSF Award ID 1632116) Final Report Figure 3. Stalled Vehicle Detection Using Pixel-Based Approach (Source: ISU) ATSSA.com | Page 5 Hawaii Department of Transportation: Safety Analytics Platform Using AI The Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) developed a safety analytics platform with AI, with broad plans to expand use of the technology to other areas. Traditionally, practitioners evaluate lagging performance metrics to better understand what improvements are needed. Agencies also apply safety analysis techniques such as crash modification factors based on the measured improvements from evaluated roadway safety strategies. In this case, HDOT designed the system with a proactive, positive focus through metrics such as lives saved, and speeds reduced. The desired outcome is zero fatalities, as HDOT uses advanced technologies, analytics, forecasting and visualizations to reduce safety issues and save lives. In Hawaii, AI provides recommendations for improvements based on data patterns, predictions, decision-support systems and recommended countermeasures. Practitioners then use the analytics to decide on strategies and devices such as rumble strips, raised pedestrian beds, pavement markings, signage, lighting and reflectivity, enforcement techniques, or a redesign of the facility. As an example, AI analyzed crash information across Honolulu and generated a map showing a forecasted number of crashes by location based on the analytics as shown in Figure 5. The map also includes a layer showing completed raised crosswalks and those in progress (green diamonds show completed and yellow diamonds show in progress). The varying shades of purple highlight the expected crashes as shown in the legend. AI forecasted 18,100 crashes and 6.9 lives saved during the three-year period from application of the recommended countermeasures. The outputs from the AI-driven platform are used to communicate with the public and with legislators to fund solutions to safety challenges and problem locations. In addition to its Safety Platform, HDOT is also using AI in its Climate Resiliency Platform. Using the platform, HDOT staff can better understand the existing hazards and forecast their potential impacts. This Figure 4. HDOT\\'s Approach to Actionable Intelligence for Safety Benefits (Source: HDOT) Figure 5. Oahu, Hawaii Forecast Prediction Model: 2022-2025 (Source: HDOT) ATSSA.com | Page 6 approach allows HDOT to be more proactive than reactive. HDOT is also planning to use AI to augment its capabilities in other programs. For example, in Human Resources, HDOT plans to use AI to process data, answer inquiries from staff, assist with processing forms and even provide recommendations on possible disciplinary actions. Another potential application includes an AI call center to assist the public by processing complaints and permits including selecting the proper forms, helping fill out those forms correctly, and processing payments as needed. In addition, there is a major effort to use AI to support asset and maintenance management decisions through dashboard visualizations that use data from requested, assigned, in progress and completed asset maintenance activities. Pavement Marking Condition Assessments Using AI Agencies are learning how AI can be used to evaluate roadway pavement markings to determine compliance with appropriate local, state and federal standards and to predictively perform maintenance activities. One innovative source of data for evaluating pavement marking conditions is aerial imagery. Such imagery is already used in the insurance industry for damage assessment for properties, buildings and other structures, as it contains attributes needed to evaluate claims quickly and effectively. A similar approach is also being used for transportation facilities, as evidenced by recent assessments in Georgia and North Carolina. In one example covering parts of the City of Atlanta, Ga., AI with aerial imagery has been shown to provide new ways to assess the condition of urban markings through a color-coded map of locations. The map includes green dots and red dots, where green indicates the markings are adequate and red indicates locations where markings need to be upgraded. Based on predetermined parameters the user can toggle between, AI evaluates the data and identifies the locations for improvements. Figure 6. City of Atlanta, Ga., Example User Interface (Source: Paul Carlson) ATSSA.com | Page 7 In the City of Greensboro, N.C., AI capabilities were demonstrated to evaluate pavement markings, with expanded application to pedestrian facilities including accessibility standards compliance. In a similar format to that highlighted for the City of Atlanta, the outputs generated by AI can be used to create a maintenance and facility upgrade program. Using an AI-generated database with tags for items, the system provides a count of needs including those rated in “poor” condition (based on a quality score) and an estimate of replacement costs for the items. Based on this detail, practitioners can prioritize needs and secure funding for projects. There are several benefits to using aerial imagery in combination with AI for analysis of facilities. For roadway applications, aerial imagery data is less expensive than other sources, and AI and other tools are available and being expanded. The time required to obtain the data is also shorter using aerial images, and oblique and ortho images can be stitched together to minimize occlusions and provide the necessary horizontal and vertical resolution. The examples highlighted in this section are possible in large part due to the ability of AI to process the large scale data sets generated for these areas. Figure 7. Sample AI-Supported Cost Estimates for Marking Improvements in North Carolina (Source: Paul Carlson) ATSSA.com | Page 8 Research on AI Planning Data Applications Transportation planning applications require data and models to adequately evaluate needs and develop improvement programs for transportation management areas. To support data collection and processing, researchers at The Ohio State University (OSU) are studying a novel method4 for counting and tracking vehicles on public roadways. The technology takes advantage of existing bus security cameras to process video images and automatically count vehicles, detect objects in the roadway, and distinguish moving vehicles from those that are parked. Since the cameras are mounted inside the bus, they are mobile and therefore provide much better spatial and temporal coverage compared with fixed roadside sensors and cameras. AI automates the process of identifying vehicles in the video data sets. This allows for faster and more efficient processing of video data as compared with human processing. This application uses YOLOv4 to detect and track objects. The data are currently taken from OSU campus buses, providing an existing data source for AI processing. The integration is simple and cost effective since the buses are already equipped with the cameras used for security and other needs. Researchers cite other future benefits, including intelligent traffic surveillance, enhanced roadway network mapping and asset management. For the traveling public, the benefits are reduced travel times and greater route choices via real-time information. The results of this research can be applied to other transportation agency video data collection and allow for automated processing without much human intervention. The research is supported by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) Mobility21 University Transportation Center Program. 4 https://engineering.osu.edu/news/2023/07/study-taps-ai-improve-future-road-planning Figure 8. OSU Bus Equipped with AI-Connected Video Cameras (Image: OSU) ATSSA.com | Page 9 Other Research on AI ATSSA prioritized the expanded case study examples included in this report due to their direct tie to transportation safety along with the availability of information on each. Following is a list of additional examples of AI applications for transportation that are in the early stages of development. Pothole Detection from Dash Camera Images using YOLOv5 A study by researchers at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles evaluated a machine learning application for accuracy in detecting potholes for repair. The approach used dash camera images along with a deep learning based object detection (You Only Look Once version 5, or YOLOv5). The solution obtained higher detection accuracy at faster speeds as compared with previous approaches. The technology could provide safety benefits as compared with user reporting or maintenance personnel observations, such as through faster repair and less vehicle damage or impacts to motorists while traveling. It could also provide greater cost savings over traditional maintenance approaches to surface repairs.

The process improves efficiency, quality and safety, reducing the risk to workers in the field. The system can be installed on existing equipment, making it adaptable to nearly any existing contractor configuration. Source: Limntech Scientific Inc. Category: Maintenance Situational Awareness for Transportation Management: Automated Video Incident Detection and Other Machine Learning Technologies for the Traffic Management Center The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the University of California, Irvine, researched and created a synthesis of Automated Video Incident Detection (AID) systems along with general traffic monitoring for detection, verification and response practices. Inputs to the process include law enforcement channels, public reporting by phone and video camera systems. Past attempts with automated incident detection models have not proven as useful as originally desired, and AI can provide greater benefits. This report synthesizes techniques to characterize traffic conditions, identify incidents and improve incident detection, verification and response.

Fuzzy logic is different from traditional AI in that it does not require complete, accurate data to make decisions. Fuzzy logic is considered a subset of AI.

Wood avatar]()\\n![fa-solid fa-share](/api/fontawesome/fa-solid%20fa-share.svg)\\n![fa-regular fa-bookmark](/api/fontawesome/fa-regular%20fa-bookmark.svg)\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is being used to improve processes across the logistics industry, from predicting demand and managing inventory to optimizing transportation and increasing visibility. More than half of logistics companies [believe](https://transportlogistic.de/en/discover/industry-insights/detail/artificial-intelligence-revolutionizes-logistics.html?utm_source=vktr.com) that AI usage will grow, saying that most companies will use AI in the next few years. Here, we look at several examples of companies applying AI to inform and power logistics.\\n\\n## [1. BMW](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/case-studies/paving-the-future-of-factories-with-nvidia-omniverse-enterprise/?utm_source=vktr.com)\\n\\nBMW car buyers love to customize their ride. They buy 2.5 million cars a year and 99% of those are tweaked before purchase to match the buyers’ dreams, according to a case study. This is a logistical challenge for manufacturing.\\n\\nTo help get it right, BMW used NVIDIA Omniverse to capture data in real-time and use AI to create a realistic, accurate digital twin of the factory they use to design the workflows to create new vehicles. This virtual process let engineers pull all the relevant data from disparate sources and work together in a virtual space while they plan the tasks that a total of 57,000 humans and thousands of intelligent robots perform as well as optimize material flow during production.\\n\\n“Omniverse greatly enhances the precision, speed and consequently the efficiency of our planning processes,” says Milan Nedeljkovic, board member for production, BMW.\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\n## [2. Best Home Furnishings](https://sifted.com/case-studies/best-home-furnishings/?utm_source=vktr.com)\\n\\nBest Home Furnishings was spending $1.2 million annually on shipping. When it was time to evaluate the company’s parcel carrier agreements, the Best Home Furnishings leaders felt they could find savings, according to a case study.\\n\\nBest Home Furnishings turned to AI-powered logistics company Sifted for help analyzing their spending. Sifted used AI to help review invoices, ratings and discounts to quickly audit transactions and find opportunities. Though the largest carrier they used told the team the shipping agreement was already competitive, Sifted told Best Homan Furnishings otherwise. The company also sought a better deal from another major carrier.\\n\\n“Sifted’s comparative analysis of the two quotes was one of the most helpful things they did,” says Steve Wahl, CFO and treasurer, Best Home Furnishings. “The amount of additional work on our end was minimal, because Sifted was working behind the scenes to make it easier for us.”\\n\\nBest Home Furnishings used Sifted’s intelligent analysis to guide their negotiations with the major shipping carriers, garnering significant discounts.\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\n## [3. Poloplast](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1752163541659183955-poloplast-dynamics-365-supply-chain-management-discrete-manufacturing-en-austria?utm_source=vktr.com)\\n\\nAustrian pipe manufacturer Poloplast struggled with demand planning, according to a case study. Every month, the team pulled out spreadsheets, data and estimates to calculate how much raw material it would need to meet customer demand for its products. A great deal of money and customer satisfaction rode on the estimates. But they had to pull data from a system of inaccurate, disjointed systems to make them.\\n\\n“The production planners made decisions based on institutional knowledge and work experience, rather than a connection to forecasting,” says Holger Kreisel, head of enterprise resource planning, Poloplast.\\n\\nPoloplast moved its data and process to Microsoft’s Demand 365 Supply Chain Management as part of its digital transformation and move to the cloud. The transformation was intended to improve the demand planning process and connect all the systems. The migration gave the team a single source of truth for data related to their supply chain.\\n\\nThe app used AI to help support precise forecasting and improved accuracy.\\n\\n“We are all operating with a shared understanding and asking informed questions now,” says Siegfried Wögerbauer, head of supply chain management and sales logistics, Poloplast.\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\n## [4. Emerson](https://www.oracle.com/customers/emerson/?utm_source=vktr.com)\\n\\nEmerson wanted to better understand its supply chain to react to events, prevent disruption, control costs and cut carbon emissions, according to a case study.\\n\\nEmerson turned to Oracle Transportation Management to better access and understand the data around its supply chain. The tool enabled the supply chain team to more intelligently select the right carrier and service level to achieve goals while improving delivery times — despite global disasters and weather events.\\n\\n“We were able to reroute freight to different modes around volcanoes, hurricanes, floods,” says Don Sorg, director of supply chain systems and solutions, Emerson.\\n\\nEven when there are no disasters, Emerson improved its on-time delivery and cut costs, and it is optimized all of its transportation to cut emissions.\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\n## [5. IBM](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-supply-chain?utm_source=vktr.com)\\n\\nIBM’s supply chain was running on legacy systems spread across global organizational silos even while the company itself was busy developing emerging technologies, such as AI, the internet of things (IoT) and edge computing.\\n\\n“We saw the advances IBM was making in all these new technologies,” says Ron Castro, VP of supply chain, IBM. “So we asked, ‘Why not leverage our own technology to move our own supply chain forward?’”\\n\\nIBM set out to build a cognitive supply chain that used data and AI to lower costs, exceed customer expectations, reduce labor and improve the experience for everyone working on the supply chain team. IBM Consulting helped design the supply chain transformation. The process is powered by IBM Cognitive Supply Chain Advisor 360, which runs on IBM Hybrid Cloud and Red Hat OpenShift.\\n\\nThe cognitive supply chain provided the company with real-time, intelligent supply chain visibility that can respond to changes in demand as they happen. It used Watson as an interface, allowing users to use natural language queries to get answers.\\n\\n![]()\\n![nashville]()\\n![Chameleon Tech: A chameleon changing colors to blend with various tech environments, symbolizing adaptability and versatility in technology solutions.]()\\n![AI Agent]()\\n![Shopping cart]()\\n![Healthcare Ops with AI]()\\n![]()\\n![nashville]()\\n![Chameleon Tech: A chameleon changing colors to blend with various tech environments, symbolizing adaptability and versatility in technology solutions.]()\\n\\n“Guaranteed supply is important, but many of our clients are also looking for predictability of supply,” Castro says. “The tools we have now help us address both issues. They enable us to manage the demand side to meet the right client expectations.”\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\n![Christina X. Wood]()\\n\\nChristina X. Wood is a working writer and novelist.

AI has the potential to optimize healthcare financing systems. This study provides an overview of the AI application domains in healthcare financing.\\n\\n### Method\\n\\nWe conducted a scoping review in six steps: formulating research questions, identifying relevant studies by conducting a comprehensive literature search using appropriate keywords, screening titles and abstracts for relevance, reviewing full texts of relevant articles, charting extracted data, and compiling and summarizing findings. Specifically, the research question sought to identify the applications of artificial intelligence in health financing supported by the published literature and explore potential future applications. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched between 2000 and 2023.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe discovered that AI has a significant impact on various aspects of health financing, such as governance, revenue raising, pooling, and strategic purchasing. We provide evidence-based recommendations for establishing and improving the health financing system based on AI.\\n\\n### Conclusions\\n\\nTo ensure that vulnerable groups face minimum challenges and benefit from improved health financing, we urge national and international institutions worldwide to use and adopt AI tools and applications.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nIn the era of AI, with the rapid development of information technology (IT) and various data types, areas such as machine learning (ML) and big data [[1](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR1 \"Kunwar, M. Artificial intelligence in finance: Understanding how automation and machine learning is transforming the financial industry. Bachelor Thesis. Centria University of Applied Sciences, Finland. 2019.\")] have become essential components of decision-making. An important economic and public health concern worldwide is the financial burden of health care and diseases [[2](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR2 \"Jödicke AM, Zellweger U, Tomka IT, Neuer T, Curkovic I, Roos M, et al. Prediction of health care expenditure increase: how does pharmacotherapy contribute? BMC Health Serv Res. 2019;19(1):1–11.\")]. AI is a broad term related to advancements that make machines “intelligent” and aims to develop an intelligent and autonomous system. ML enables computers to automatically learn and improve their understanding as a subset of AI without explicit programming. The origin of AI can be traced over fifty years back, its rapidly increasing possibilities in various fields have significantly risen during the past few years [[1](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR1 \"Kunwar, M. Artificial intelligence in finance: Understanding how automation and machine learning is transforming the financial industry. Bachelor Thesis. Centria University of Applied Sciences, Finland. 2019.\")].\\n\\nAs countries are challenged with rising healthcare costs, they seek to protect their citizens and vulnerable groups from unaffordable high healthcare expenditures and to ensure access to comprehensive, non-discriminatory healthcare services [[3](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR3 \"Akca N, Sonmez S, Yilmaz A. Determinants of health expenditure in OECD countries: a decision tree model. Pakistan J Med Sci. 2017;33(6):1490.\")]. In recent years, policymakers, national public health managers, and academics have become increasingly concerned with financing public health. Additionally, the high data dimensionality caused by the abundance of risk factors for patient expenditure, such as demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, etc. makes complex and unpredictable systems [[4](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR4 \"Li L, Bagheri S, Goote H, Hasan A, & Hazard G.

To handle the massive health data, new approaches apply numerous machine learning algorithms. AI applications in healthcare management can help to close the gap between available resources and public healthcare demand. As AI develops, more and more healthcare management applications are being used [[5](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR5 \"Lan Z, Zhou G, Zhang Y, Duan Y, Yan W, & Chi C.

Strategy, coordinated implementation, and sustainable financing needed for COVID-19 innovations. The Lancet. 2020;396(10261):1469–71.\")]. The majority of real-world financial systems exhibit nonlinear and uncertain behaviors that may change over time. As a result, there is a greater need to solve highly nonlinear, time-variant challenges, for which AI is gaining popularity [[8](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR8 \"Bahrammirzaee A. A comparative survey of artificial intelligence applications in finance: artificial neural networks, expert system and hybrid intelligent systems. Neural Comput Appl. 2010;19(8):1165–95.\")]. In other words, these new applications are replacing older ones that could only estimate short-term flow by calculating all relevant variables and establishing current and potential future relationships [[9](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR9 \"Wang WR.

This article aims to highlight recent applications of the implementation of AI in health financing in light of recent AI advancements and identify potential future research areas.\\n\\nMethods\\n-------\\n\\nIn line with its objectives, we adopted a scoping review framework guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s methodology, including six steps: 1- identifying the research question; 2- identifying relevant studies; 3-selecting included studies; 4-data charting; 5-summarizing and reporting the results; and 6- consultation with experts [[11](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR11 \"Arksey H, O’Malley L. Scoping studies: towards a methodological framework. Int J Soc Res Methodol. 2005;8(1):19–32.\")].\\n\\nFollowing the first step, we formulated research questions as follows: (1) Which applications of AI in health financing are reported in the literature? (2) What future health financing applications and capabilities can be employed? We then identified relevant studies according to appropriate keywords, and two independent researchers, MR and AB, conducted a comprehensive literature search through three databases: PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Scopus (Table[1](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#Tab1)). In the third step, two independent authors MR and AB, screened the relevance of titles and abstracts of articles and reviewed the full texts of the relevant articles. We charted the extracted data in the fourth step and collated, summarized, and reported in the fifth step. Finally, we reported the synthesized results to the research team and one external advisor for approval.\\n\\n### Inclusion criteria for study selection\\n\\nInclusion criteria were studies published in English on financing health systems (inclusively or exclusively) from 2000 to 2023.

AI can also facilitate the efficient monitoring of resource allocation of governments, donors, and development agencies involved in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Future studies can explore the simultaneous social and financial impact of different interventions to improve the efficient use of resources for development and create insights about additional opportunities to substantially impact the well-being of people worldwide [[25](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR25 \"Gonzales Martínez R.

AI has the potential to address many of the current challenges faced by nations, such as reducing unemployment, improving public sector efficiency, enhancing environmental conditions, fostering innovation, and increasing national economic competitiveness [[26](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR26 \"Veselovsky MY, Pogodina TV, Ilyukhina RV, Sigunova TA, Kuzovleva NF.

These changes will be related to reducing the burden of comorbidities, addressing lifestyle factors such as smoking, and screening for cancers and cardiovascular diseases, that need to be targeted to lower the mortality and cost associated with diseases [[27](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR27 \"Prodel M, Finkielsztejn L, Roustand L, Nachbaur G, De Leotoing L, Genreau M et al.

One of these innovative approaches adopted by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria (GFATM) to health financing has had significant flow-on effects on the knowledge system that supports efforts to combat the three subject diseases in target countries. By considering itself as part of a more extensive knowledge system, the GFATM can use this influence to build the capacity across that system to learn from implementation and refine its processes accordingly [[28](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR28 \"Van Kerkhoff L, Szlezák N.

Decision-makers can select from several rational resource allocation models depending on the data availability and complexity level. For example, S4HARA (System for HIV/AIDS resource allocation) is a four-step spreadsheet-based model for a rational resource allocation approach. Recommendations of the model are grounded in the cultural, social, and political context [[32](https://resource-allocation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12962-023-00492-2#ref-CR32 \"Lasry A, Carter MW, Zaric GS.

The study aims to describe AI in healthcare, including important technologies like robotics, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), and to investigate how these technologies are used in patient interaction, predictive analytics, and remote monitoring. The goal of this review is to present a thorough analysis of AI\\'s effects on healthcare while providing stakeholders with a road map for navigating this changing environment.\\n\\n**Methods:** This review analyzes the impact of AI on healthcare using data from the Web of Science (2014-2024), focusing on keywords like AI, ML, and healthcare applications. It examines the uses and effects of AI on healthcare by synthesizing recent literature and real-world case studies, such as Google Health and IBM Watson Health, highlighting AI technologies, their useful applications, and the difficulties in putting them into practice, including problems with data security and resource limitations. The review also discusses new developments in AI, and how they can affect society.\\n\\n**Results:** The findings demonstrate how AI is enhancing the skills of medical professionals, enhancing diagnosis, and opening the door to more individualized treatment plans, as reflected in the steady rise of AI-related healthcare publications from 158 articles (3.54%) in 2014 to 731 articles (16.33%) by 2024. Core applications like remote monitoring and predictive analytics improve operational effectiveness and patient involvement. However, there are major obstacles to the mainstream implementation of AI in healthcare, including issues with data security and budget constraints.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Healthcare may be transformed by AI, but its successful use requires ethical and responsible use. To meet the changing demands of the healthcare sector and guarantee the responsible application of AI technologies, the evaluation highlights the necessity of ongoing research, instruction, and multidisciplinary cooperation. In the future, integrating AI responsibly will be essential to optimizing its advantages and reducing related dangers.\\n\\n**Keywords:** AI ethics; AI technologies; Healthcare Business; data Analytics; digital Health.\\n\\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Introduction\\n---------------\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, exploiting machine learning (ML) algorithms, data analytics, and automation, is enduring a paradigm transition by improving medical decision‐making, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes, with the potential to boost productivity, care quality, and ease costs [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001)]. The delivery, administration, and patient experience of healthcare are all being completely transformed by the advancement of AI‐driven technology and further its integration into existing systems [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0002), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)]. This in‐depth study looks at how AI is significantly impacting the healthcare sector, improving diagnostic precision through data analysis, streamlining treatment planning through predictive algorithms, and shedding light on how these advancements are challenging accepted wisdom and setting new benchmarks for quality [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005)]. Najjar (2023) showcased AI\\'s revolutionary potential in several healthcare sectors. In diagnostics, AI‐powered diagnostic tools have shown remarkable accuracy in diagnosing diseases including cancer, heart issues, and neurological disorders, particularly in the area of medical imaging. These technologies frequently outperform human clinicians in this regard [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. Their speed and precision have frequently surpassed that of human professionals. ML algorithms scan vast amounts of data from imaging studies, genomes, and medical records to identify patterns and predict patient outcomes, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004)]. In addition to improving patient outcomes, AI‐powered expertise enables personalized treatment plans that cater to each patient\\'s unique requirements and boost the effectiveness of treatments [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. By analyzing patient data to suggest tailored medication, AI improves treatment success and minimizes side effects [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. These technologies can reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by remotely monitoring patients and alerting medical professionals to issues before they get worse [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0002), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)]. According to Alowais et al. (2023), AI is also greatly enhancing patient care and administrative effectiveness. Virtual health assistants driven by ML and NLP are increasingly being used to plan appointments, handle patient communications, and provide medical advice, all of which reduce the workload for medical staff [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)]. Healthcare facilities operate more effectively, and resources are directed where they are most needed because to AI\\'s capacity to manage massive information and optimize workflows [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)]. By optimizing treatment plans, getting rid of unnecessary procedures, and improving diagnosis accuracy, AI has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare expenditures. Bajwa et. al. (2021) touched on one of the main factors influencing AI\\'s adoption is its ability to lower healthcare expenses [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001)]. One of the primary drivers of AI adoption, according to Bajwa et al. (2021), is its potential to reduce healthcare costs [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001)]. Predictive analytics is a significant use of AI in healthcare that supports patient demand forecasting, population health management, and resource allocation. Since early detection and tailored treatment can prevent costly outcomes and hospital admissions, these qualities are particularly beneficial in the management of chronic illnesses [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\\n\\nAI in healthcare must overcome several significant challenges if it is to live up to its full potential. Ethical concerns such as safeguarding patient privacy and avoiding bias in AI systems must be taken into consideration. There are concerns about data security and potential misuse because AI systems rely on massive amounts of data [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)]. To ensure that the highest safety and efficacy standards are fulfilled and to oversee the development and use of AI technology in healthcare, robust regulatory frameworks are also necessary [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0008)].\\n\\nAdditionally, for the healthcare industry to adopt AI, a cultural shift must occur. By automating processes like scheduling, billing, and patient triage and allocating resources optimally to cut down on wait times and enhance workflow overall, AI also increases operational competence [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005)]. Healthcare professionals must understand the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology and be ready to handle them. Collaboration between AI developers, healthcare practitioners, and legislators is essential to the development of systems that are not just technologically advanced but also aligned with the needs and values of patients and providers [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)]. To enable prompt reactions, AI‐driven surveillance systems use ML algorithms to identify trends and early warning indicators of disease outbreaks [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0009), [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0058)]. AI models forecast epidemics and track the spread of diseases like influenza, monkeypox, chikungunya and COVID‐19 by analyzing symptoms, travel records, and environmental data [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0008)], helping public health officials allocate resources, implement prevention strategies, and tackle emergent health threats [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\\n\\nAt the outset, AI is more than just a technological advancement—it is what is propelling the advancement of healthcare. Its capacity to transform patient care, diagnostics, and operational effectiveness offers hope for a more individualized, effective, and accessible healthcare system in the future [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0008)]. As AI develops, ethical, legal, and cultural issues must be carefully considered before integrating it into the healthcare industry. By overcoming these obstacles, AI can live up to its potential of revolutionizing healthcare into a more efficient and just system where human judgment and technological know‐how combine to provide better treatment [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\\n\\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of AI\\'s implications for the healthcare sector, emphasizing how it affects operational effectiveness, treatment planning, and diagnosis. The following important sections make up the structure of the manuscript. The methodology is described in Section [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-sec-0060), which also includes information on the databases, keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction, and synthesis used in this investigation. Understanding AI in healthcare is examined in Section [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-sec-0100), market dynamics and the development of AI throughout time are examined in Section [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-sec-0140), and the use of AI in the healthcare industry is examined in Section 5.

Finally, the data were presented as narrative or thematic summaries, organized by key themes or objectives, with the results displayed in Figure[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-fig-0001).\\n\\n#### Figure 1.\\n\\n![Image 9: Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b76e/11702416/22a8d0baab46/HSR2-8-e70312-g003.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/figure/hsr270312-fig-0001/)\\n\\nThematic summary and statistical overview of AI\\'s Impact on healthcare.\\n\\nThis comprehensive review examines the impact of AI on healthcare, synthesizing data from review articles, research studies, patents, copyrighted works, and early access publications retrieved from the WoS (Web of Science) database. The search strings utilized specific keywords, including “AI”; “ML”; “healthcare applications”; “diagnostics”; “treatment”; “predictive modeling”; “molecular docking”; “personalized therapeutics”; “ethics”; and “epidemic predicting”. The search focused on titles, abstracts, and keywords from 2014 to 2024. The results indicate that 158 articles were published in 2014, representing 3.54% of the total available data. By 2023, this number had increased more than fourfold to 653 articles, comprising 14.61% of the total published data. As of October 2024, 731 articles have been published, accounting for 16.33% of the total available data.\\n\\n3. Understanding Al in Healthcare\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nAI is a disruptive force in the healthcare industry that involves novel ideas and changes in conventional methods. This section provides a thorough overview of AI in healthcare, including everything from its basic description to its current acceptance status [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)].\\n\\n### 3.1. What Is Al in Healthcare?\\n\\nThe development of computer systems capable of carrying out operations often associated with human intellect is known as AI. Within the healthcare domain, AI manifests through diverse modalities, including ML algorithms, NLP and robotics [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005)]. These technological facets collectively empower machines to scrutinize intricate medical data, discern patterns, and render informed decisions. In effect, AI serves as a transformative augmentation of healthcare professionals’ capabilities [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. AI in healthcare is a paradigm change that affects patient interaction, treatment plans, administrative procedures, and diagnosis. Improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare delivery, and raising the standard of care are the main objectives. AI is a flexible toolset rather than a single fix, providing a range of applications that address various facets of the healthcare environment [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\\n\\n### 3.2. Types of Al in Healthcare\\n\\nML algorithms are essential to the healthcare industry because they make it easier to identify patterns and trends in large datasets. Another aspect of AI is NLP, which enables robots to understand and communicate with human language. This makes it easier to perform activities like voice‐activated devices or language‐based data analysis. Robots, a kind of AI, are used in healthcare through automated procedures and hands‐on support during procedures or patient care [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. The hierarchical structure and interdependencies between AI, ML, and DL are depicted in Figure[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-fig-0002). As general AI concepts give way to the next generation of advanced, data‐driven learning performances, the correlations show how specificity and complexity increase from AI to DL.\\n\\n#### Figure 2.\\n\\n![Image 10: Figure\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 10: Enhancing interpretability and accuracy of AI models in healthcare: a ... ---\\nURL: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nFrontiers | Enhancing interpretability and accuracy of AI models in healthcare: a comprehensive review on challenges and future directions Enhancing interpretability and accuracy of AI models in healthcare: a comprehensive review on challenges and future directions Our systematic review explores various AI applications in healthcare, focusing on the critical assessment of model interpretability and accuracy. While current literature highlights the use of AI in healthcare, the research gaps in terms of model generalizability, lack of real-time interpretability, and inclusion of diverse clinical data remain relatively unexplored.

The integration of AI in healthcare promises substantial improvements in patient outcomes, including faster diagnosis and personalized treatment plans. However, AI models frequently lack interpretability, leading to significant challenges concerning their performance and generalizability across diverse patient populations. These opaque AI technologies raise serious patient safety concerns, as non-interpretable models can result in improper treatment decisions due to misinterpretations by healthcare providers. Our systematic review explores various AI applications in healthcare, focusing on the critical assessment of model interpretability and accuracy. We identify and elucidate the most significant limitations of current AI systems, such as the black-box nature of deep learning models and the variability in performance across different clinical settings. By addressing these challenges, our objective is to provide healthcare providers with well-informed strategies to develop innovative and safe AI solutions. This review aims to ensure that future AI implementations in healthcare not only enhance performance but also maintain transparency and patient safety.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n--------------\\n\\nIn recent years, AI technology has enabled the widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods in healthcare. These techniques have automated various processes like screening, diagnostics, and treatment ([Zhongqi and Jia, 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B116)). However, DL algorithms are often considered “black boxes” due to their intricate training and numerous parameters, making it hard to decipher the connection between inputs and outputs ([Zhang and Zhang, 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B114)). Although advanced DL methods can significantly improve speed and accuracy without human intervention, establishing an interpretable AI framework remains imperative. Understanding algorithms’ inner workings and prediction bases is essential, not just competitively but also for stakeholder trust ([Stinson and Vlaad, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B101)). Discussing trustworthy AI involves the terms accuracy, interpretability, and explainability, which are occasionally used interchangeably. In data mining and machine learning, interpretability is the interface between people and decision models that accurately represents the model and is intelligible to humans ([Savindu Herath Pathirannehelage et al., 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B87)).\\n\\n2 Research gaps\\n---------------\\n\\nWhile current literature highlights the use of AI in healthcare, the research gaps in terms of model generalizability, lack of real-time interpretability, and inclusion of diverse clinical data remain relatively unexplored. Additionally, the integration of uncertainty quantification with interpretability models is an underexamined area that could improve AI adoption in healthcare settings. Gaps related to real-time feedback for clinicians and the role of user-centered design in AI development also need further exploration ([Helman et al., 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B118)).\\n\\nThis paper characterizes the challenges of AI applications in healthcare focused on interpretability and accuracy to ensure accountability and regulatory compliance. Our survey helps healthcare providers develop appropriate strategies to rapidly implement innovative solutions safely. The goal is consolidating existing knowledge on AI systems and the interpretability models to help researchers swiftly grasp the state-of-the-art and determine areas needing more research ([Saeed and Omlin, 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B84)). We also distinguish our review from earlier studies by focusing on both the technical and practical limitations of AI in healthcare, which are often overlooked in previous reviews, such as those focusing solely on specific AI techniques or healthcare applications.\\n\\nThe primary contributions of this work include:\\n\\n• Summarizing the current state of AI systems in healthcare.\\n\\n• Identifying and detailing the key limitations encountered when developing AI systems, with a focus on both interpretability and accuracy.\\n\\n• Discussing the research gaps and future challenges in AI application in healthcare.\\n\\n• Offering a detailed comparison of how this review differs from previous literature, including works like ([Sadeghi et al., 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B83)).\\n\\nAdditionally, we consider the control strategy presented by [Stefanelli et al. (2023)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B100) in their work on sensorimotor control in prosthetics, which integrates both force and temperature information to replicate human reflexive behavior during manipulation. This approach provides valuable insights into designing more human-like AI systems in healthcare by considering multimodal sensory inputs.\\n\\n3 Methodology\\n-------------\\n\\nTo achieve our objectives, we systematically reviewed 61 AI systems for classifying and treating various diseases in healthcare. The selected systems were analyzed by extracting how they address the challenges of assessing AI systems in terms of interpretability and accuracy. Our work defines the black box of healthcare AI applications, emphasizing model interpretability and accuracy.\\n\\n### 3.1 Search strategy\\n\\nWe conducted our search using multiple databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore, to ensure comprehensive coverage of the literature. The search was conducted using the following keywords, combined with Boolean operators:\\n\\n• “Artificial Intelligence” AND “Healthcare” AND “Accuracy”\\n\\n• “Deep Learning” AND “Interpretability” AND “Healthcare”\\n\\n• “Machine Learning” AND “Explainability” AND “Healthcare”\\n\\n### 3.2 Inclusion criteria\\n\\n• Peer-reviewed articles focused on healthcare AI applications.\\n\\n• Studies published between 2010 and 2024.\\n\\n• Articles emphasizing interpretability and/or accuracy (both ML and DL).\\n\\n### 3.3 Exclusion criteria\\n\\n• Articles not focused on AI techniques (i.e., non technical).\\n\\n• Non-healthcare AI applications.\\n\\n• Legislative or legal discussions that do not contribute to the technical understanding of interpretability.\\n\\n### 3.4 Data extraction\\n\\nFor each selected study, we extracted information on:\\n\\n• The AI model used.\\n\\n• The metrics employed to assess interpretability and accuracy.\\n\\n• The context in which the AI model was applied.\\n\\n• A detailed discussion on the results achieved.\\n\\nThe results of the literature analysis are summarized in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#T1).\\n\\nTable 1\\n\\n [![Image 7: www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1444763/frobt-11-1444763-HTML-r1/image_m/frobt-11-1444763-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1444763/frobt-11-1444763-HTML-r1/image_m/frobt-11-1444763-t001.jpg)**Table 1**.

PRISMA diagram illustrates the article selection process.\\n\\n### 3.5 Study limitations\\n\\nOur review primarily focuses on AI models applied in diagnostic imaging tasks. While we have considered various healthcare applications (e.g., screening, and treatment decision-making), our scope does not extend to other domains like genomics or personalized medicine, which could benefit from AI innovations. Additionally, the lack of real-time applicability and the high computational cost of certain models have not been deeply explored in this review.\\n\\n4 Summary of selected literature\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nWe reviewed 61 papers that applied AI models in various healthcare contexts. [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#T1) summarizes the key information extracted from each paper, including the AI model used, the metrics for accuracy and interpretability, and the results achieved.\\n\\n5 Key metrics in AI model development\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nDespite the numerous benefits, AI models in healthcare are not without limitations. These include:\\n\\n### 5.1 The accuracy\\n\\nAccuracy is paramount in healthcare applications, especially for tasks like diagnostic imaging and predictive modeling. AI systems can often surpass human experts in detecting abnormalities ([Esteva et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B24)). However, the performance of AI models is typically evaluated using historical data, split into training and testing sets. This method, though widely used, does not always reflect real-world performance ([Baeza-Yates, 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B7)). The trade-off between model complexity and accuracy is an ongoing challenge.\\n\\n### 5.2 The interpretability\\n\\nInterpretability in AI refers to the degree to which a human can understand and trust the decisions made by AI systems. In the context of healthcare, interpretability is paramount because medical professionals rely on these systems to make critical decisions about patient care. Without a clear understanding of how AI systems arrive at their conclusions, healthcare providers may be reluctant to adopt these technologies or may misinterpret their recommendations, potentially leading to adverse patient outcomes ([Ennab and Mcheick, 2022b](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B23)). Techniques like activation visualization enable us to infer which features in an image are represented by each feature map within every layer of the trained convolutional neural network. When activation visualization is needed, it involves inputting sample medical images into the convolutional neural network for analysis and observing the patterns in the results ([Kim, 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B55)).\\n\\n### 5.3 The interpretability-accuracy trade-off\\n\\nAs highlighted ([Ennab and Mcheick, 2022a](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B22)), there is often a trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. While simpler models like decision trees are more interpretable, they may not achieve the same level of accuracy as more complex models, such as deep neural networks ([Escalante et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B119)).\\n\\n6 AI models in healthcare\\n-------------------------\\n\\nThe field of medicine has employed AI technology to automate various stages of clinical research, offering valuable assistance for clinical decision-making ([Wu Yazhou and Chen, 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B109)). Utilizing AI techniques across diverse medical domains brings advantages such as enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing both time and labor requirements. Leveraging the latest AI advancements, typical applications experiencing revolutionary changes include intelligent screening, precise diagnosis, risk prediction, and supportive therapy ([Khalifa et al., 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1444763/full#B50)) as shown in [Figure 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-a\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n'}}\n",

All of it comes through a standardized interface, so your LLM can stay lightweight and clean.\\n\\n**Function Routing & Invocation**  \\nMCP also lets models call tools dynamically. You can register capabilities like `searchCustomerData` or `generateReport`, and the LLM can invoke them on demand. It’s like giving your AI access to a toolbox, but without hardwiring the tools into the model itself.\\n\\n`searchCustomerData`\\n`generateReport`\\n\\n**Prompt Orchestration**  \\nRather than stuffing your prompt with every possible detail, MCP helps assemble just the context that matters. Think modular, on-the-fly prompt construction — smarter context, fewer tokens, better outputs.\\n\\n## Implementation Characteristics\\n\\n## Engineering Use Cases\\n\\n➀ **LLM integrations for internal APIs:** Enable secure, read-only or interactive access to structured business data without exposing raw endpoints.\\n\\n➁ **Enterprise agents:** Equip autonomous agents with runtime context from tools like Salesforce, SAP, or internal knowledge bases.\\n\\n➂ **Dynamic prompt construction:** Tailor prompts based on user session, system state, or task pipeline logic\\n\\n# What is ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)?\\n\\n[The Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is an open standard originally proposed by BeeAI and IBM](https://github.com/orgs/i-am-bee/discussions/284) to enable structured communication, discovery, and coordination between AI agents operating in the same local or edge environment.\\n\\nUnlike cloud-oriented protocols such as A2A or context-routing protocols like MCP, ACP is designed for local-first, real-time agent orchestration with minimal network overhead and tight integration across agents deployedc within a shared runtime.\\n\\n# Protocol Design & Architecture\\n\\nACP defines a decentralized agent environment in which:\\n\\nACP agents typically operate as lightweight, stateless services or containers with a shared communication substrate.\\n\\n## Implementation Characteristics\\n\\n## Engineering Use Cases\\n\\n➀ **Multi-agent orchestration on edge devices** (e.g., drones, IoT clusters, or robotic fleets)\\n\\n➁ **Local-first LLM systems** coordinating model invocations, sensor inputs, and action execution\\n\\n➂ **Autonomous runtime environments** where agents must coordinate without centralized cloud infrastructure\\n\\nIn short, ACP offers a runtime-local protocol layer for modular AI systems — prioritizing low-latency coordination, resilience, and composability. It’s a natural fit for privacy-sensitive, autonomous, or edge-first deployments where cloud-first protocols are impractical.\\n\\n# What is A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)?\\n\\n[The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol, introduced by Google,](https://github.com/google/A2A) is a cross-platform specification for enabling AI agents to communicate, collaborate, and delegate tasks across heterogeneous systems.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nUnlike ACP’s local-first focus or MCP’s tool integration layer, A2A addresses horizontal interoperability — standardizing how agents from different vendors or runtimes can exchange capabilities and coordinate workflows over the open web.\\n\\n## Protocol Overview\\n\\nA2A defines a HTTP-based communication model where agents are treated as interoperable services. Each agent exposes an “Agent Card” — a machine-readable JSON descriptor detailing its identity, capabilities, endpoints, and authentication requirements.\\n\\nAgents use this information to:\\n\\nA2A is transport-layer agnostic in principle, but currently specifies JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTPS as its core mechanism for interaction.\\n\\n## Core Components\\n\\n**Agent Cards**JSON documents describing an agent’s capabilities, endpoints, supported message types, auth methods, and runtime metadata.\\n\\n**A2A Client/Server Interface**Each agent may function as a client (task initiator), a server (task executor), or both, enabling dynamic task routing and negotiation.\\n\\n**Message & Artifact Exchange**  \\nSupports multipart tasks with context, streaming output (via SSE), and persistent artifacts (e.g., files, knowledge chunks).\\n\\n**User Experience Negotiation**  \\nAgents can adapt message format, content granularity, and visualization to match downstream agent capabilities.\\n\\n## Security Architecture\\n\\n## Implementation Characteristics\\n\\n## Engineering Use Cases\\n\\n➀ **Cross-platform agent ecosystems** where agents from different teams or vendors need to interoperate securely\\n\\n➁ **Distributed agent orchestration** in cloud-native AI environments (e.g., Vertex AI, LangChain, HuggingFace Agents)\\n\\n➂ **Multi-agent collaboration frameworks**, such as enterprise AI workflows that span multiple systems (e.g., CRM, HR, IT agents)\\n\\n# Protocols Compared Side-by-Side\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n# Complementary or Competitive?\\n\\n## A2A + MCP\\n\\nA2A and MCP aren’t fighting each other — they’re solving totally different parts of the agentic AI puzzle, and they actually fit together pretty nicely.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nThink of MCP as the protocol that lets AI agents plug into the world. It gives them access to files, APIs, databases — basically, all the structured context they need to do something useful. Whether it’s pulling real-time sales data or generating a custom report, MCP handles the connection to tools and data.\\n\\nNow layer on A2A. This is where agents start collaborating. A2A gives them a shared language and set of rules to discover each other, delegate tasks, and negotiate how they’ll work together — even if they’re built by different vendors or running on different platforms.\\n\\nSo here’s a simple way to think about it:  \\n⟢ MCP connects AI to tools.  \\n⟢ A2A connects AI to other AI.\\n\\nTogether, they form a strong modular base for building smart, collaborative systems.\\n\\n# What About ACP?\\n\\nThen there’s ACP, which takes a different approach altogether. It’s all about local-first agent coordination — no cloud required. Instead of using HTTP and web-based discovery, ACP enables agents to find and talk to each other right inside a shared runtime.\\n\\nThis is perfect for situations where:\\n\\nACP isn’t trying to compete with A2A — it just fills a different niche. But in some setups, especially in tightly controlled environments, ACP might replace A2A entirely, because it skips the overhead of web-native protocols and just gets the job done locally.\\n\\n## Convergence or Fragmentation?\\n\\nAs more teams adopt these protocols, a few possible futures are taking shape.\\n\\n**Best case?** We see convergence. Imagine a unified agent platform where A2A handles the back-and-forth between agents, MCP manages access to tools and data, and ACP-style runtimes plug in for edge or offline scenarios. Everything just works, and developers can build on top without worrying which protocol is doing what behind the scenes.\\n\\n**Worst case?** Things fragment. Different vendors push their own flavors of A2A or MCP, and we end up with a mess — like the early days of web services, when nothing talked to anything else without a lot of glue code.\\n\\n**The middle ground?** Open-source tools and middleware could save the day. These projects would sit between agents and protocols, abstracting the differences and giving devs a clean, unified API — while translating under the hood depending on where and how your agents run.\\n\\nIn short: we’re early. But how we build and adopt these standards now will shape whether AI agents become a cohesive ecosystem — or a patchwork of silos.\\n\\nIf you’re wondering where to start or how to bring it all together, the team at [Addepto](https://addepto.com/) can help.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A) have recently rewritten the rules – no more custom code for every third-party tool and no more agent coordination headaches. These two protocols address AI\\'s connectivity crisis from different angles, and together, they\\'re saving significant development time.\\n\\nThis guide cuts through the complexity to explain how each protocol works, compares MCP vs. A2A, and suggests when to deploy MCP or A2A.\\n\\n## What is MCP?\\n\\n[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) solves the critical problem of equipping LLMs with tools and data sources. Before it existed, connecting AI to each tool required custom code. Want your AI to access Slack? Learn Slack\\'s API. Need database access? Write an SQL integration. Every connection was a separate project.\\n\\nAnthropic’s MCP changes this by providing a **universal protocol**. When AI is connected to an MCP server through an MCP client, it can discover available tools, learn their capabilities, use these tools, and get results in an AI-friendly format. In short, **LLMs can connect to external tools and sources in a standardized and automatic way** that eliminates the need for custom integrations on the user’s end.\\n\\n### MCP flow example\\n\\nConsider this simplified flow of an AI agent that can extract web data using the [Oxylabs MCP server](https://github.com/oxylabs/oxylabs-mcp):\\n\\n**User’s prompt:** *\"Is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra sold on Amazon?\"*. The AI agent recognizes it needs current Amazon search data.\\n\\n**Tool and capability discovery:** The agent uses Oxylabs MCP server and discovers four available scrapers: Universal, Google Search, Amazon Search, and Amazon Product. The AI chooses the Amazon Search scraper and sends a request with the query set to *\"Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\"*.\\n\\n**Request processing:** [Oxylabs Web Scraper API](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/web) processes the request, navigates Amazon, and returns relevant data through the MCP protocol.\\n\\n**Result analysis:** The agent receives clean data and answers the user’s question with fresh information from Amazon.\\n\\n### Key features of MCP\\n\\n**Extends AI capabilities:** AI can discover and easily use third-party tools, resources, and prompts.\\n\\n**Universal and vendor-neutral:** AI with an MCP client works out of the box with any tool or resource hosted on an MCP server.\\n\\n**Real-time data:** Connects AI to live sources instead of relying on training data.\\n\\n**Fast-growing ecosystem:** 150+ official MCP servers with integrations for Microsoft, GitHub, and Cloudflare, as well as 350+ community-driven servers.\\n\\n### MCP use cases\\n\\nFrom accessing internal knowledge bases to letting AI schedule meetings with clients, the adoption of MCP is broad. Some prominent use cases include:\\n\\n**Data extraction:** Letting any AI model get fresh information from websites (see our [Agents SDK setup](https://oxylabs.io/blog/openai-agents-sdk-integration) and [LangChain integration](https://oxylabs.io/blog/langchain-web-scraping)).\\n\\n**Development automation:** AI that can query your actual database schema before writing SQL queries.\\n\\n**Business workflows:** AI that books meetings, updates CRM, or sends emails to customers.\\n\\nWhile MCP makes AI agents smarter, there’s only so much a single agent can do. Complex workflows involve multiple agents, and this is where the A2A protocol comes into play.\\n\\n## What is A2A?\\n\\n[Agent2Agent](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A), developed by Google, tackles a different challenge: **making any remote agent work together with other agents**. In the real world, complex problems require specialists. A lawyer doesn\\'t perform surgery, and a surgeon doesn\\'t argue court cases. They collaborate when needed.\\n\\nA2A brings this model to AI with an inter-agent communication protocol. Instead of one agent trying to do everything, you have specialized agents who excel at specific tasks. The protocol lets agents find each other and collaborate while keeping their internal workings private. The major benefit of the agent-to-agent protocol is that it lets agents interact regardless of the framework they’re built on.\\n\\n### A2A flow example\\n\\nLet’s visualize agent orchestration via A2A for performing an in-depth SEO analysis, which a single agent couldn’t handle alone with confidence:\\n\\n**User’s prompt:** *\"Draft a comprehensive SEO analysis report using the top 5 ranking blog posts on Google that analyze the best RAG tools\".*\\n\\n**Agent discovery:** The client agent formulates the requirements and uses the A2A server to perform agent discovery via \"Agent Cards\" that fit this task best. It finds *Website Scraper Agent* and *SEO Analysis Agent*.\\n\\n**1st agent execution:** The A2A server sends a request to the Website Scraper Agent. It picks the Google Search Scraper from its MCP server and extracts the top 5 ranking websites for the search query *\"best RAG tools\"*. Then, it scrapes all 5 blog posts using the Universal Scraper and returns their content.\\n\\n**2nd agent execution:** The A2A server sends scraped Google results and blog posts to the SEO Analysis Agent. It uses all the provided data and internal tools from its MCP server to analyze and draft a comprehensive SEO report with key insights.\\n\\n**Final result:** The A2A client gets the final SEO report from the A2A server and passes it back to the user.\\n\\n### Key features of A2A\\n\\n**Multi-agent collaboration:** Enables autonomous agents to work together on complex, long-running tasks while delegating tasks, sharing context, progress, and results throughout the process.\\n\\n**Discovery through Agent Cards:** Agents can discover each other\\'s identity, skills, agent\\'s capabilities, authentication requirements, and connection details.\\n\\n**Multimodal communication:** Agents can negotiate which data formats they support (text, files, media, structured data).\\n\\n**Security:** Uses modern web security standards while ensuring agents collaborate without exposing internal memory, proprietary logic, and tool implementations.\\n\\n### A2A use cases\\n\\nAs with MCP, the use cases of A2A are only limited by imagination. For instance, some specific A2A use cases include the following:\\n\\n**Deep researcher:** An agentic workflow that scrapes data from different search domains, checks source trustability, aggregates content, and writes comprehensive reports.\\n\\n**Infosec analyzer:** A single agent manages a multi-agent ecosystem that performs vulnerability research, penetration testing, and drafts security reports about a web application.\\n\\n**Travel planner:** An orchestration of different agents that find the best travel deals, plan the trip, and book flights, car rentals, train tickets, hotels, and activities.\\n\\n## A2A and MCP compared\\n\\n| Aspect | Model Context Protocol | Agent2Agent |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Developer** | Anthropic | Google |\\n| **Core purpose** | Connects AI to tools & data sources | Connects AI agents to each other |\\n| **Problem solved** | Eliminates custom integrations for each tool and resource | Enables specialist agents to collaborate securely |\\n| **Architecture** | AI ↔ Tools/Resources | AI Agent ↔ AI Agent |\\n| **Focus** | Single agent interactions | Multi-agent orchestration |\\n| **Discovery method** | Tool discovery via MCP servers | Agent discovery via \"Agent Cards\" on A2A servers |\\n| **Key benefit** | Universal protocol that lets AI access data sources and tools | Framework-agnostic, context-rich, and multimodal agent collaboration |\\n| **Technologies used** | JSON-RPC 2.0, Server Sent Events, HTTP/HTTPS, stdio, TLS | JSON-RPC 2.0, Server Sent Events, HTTP/HTTPS, Webhooks, TLS |\\n| **Ecosystem** | 150+ official servers, 350+ community servers | Public or private servers hosting Agent Cards |\\n| **Best for** | Individual tasks requiring external data/tools | Complex workflows needing multiple agents |\\n| **Example use** | AI using an enterprise-grade scraper to gather Amazon data | Multiple agents that scan and test web application’s security |\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nMCP and A2A are complementary protocols building the foundation for practical AI systems. Together, they enable **AI architectures that mirror successful human teamwork**. For developers and organizations, the path is clear: implement MCP to enhance your AI with external capabilities, then adopt A2A as you scale to multi-agent systems.\\n\\nOxylabs has also introduced support for [MCP with Web Scraper API](https://oxylabs.io/blog/oxylabs-model-context-protocol). It enables developers to easily **integrate our scraping infrastructure with LLMs** and allows **AI tools to access fresh web data** without common blocks and geo-restrictions.

The Model Context Protocol gained massive adoption recently when major companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and others announced support. MCP continues to evolve with better security and features, establishing itself as the standard for AI connectivity with external tools and sources.\\n\\n### Does OpenAI support MCP?\\n\\nYes, OpenAI fully supports MCP as of March 2025. This includes integration in their Agents SDK and Responses API.\\n\\nAbout the author\\n\\n![vytenis kaubre avatar](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.prismic.io%2Foxylabs-web%2FZpArAB5LeNNTxDX4_4f38d4bd-d761-4feb-b525-27dd91f0c34e_DSC-4452.png%3Fauto%3Dformat%2Ccompress&w=1200&q=75)\\n\\nVytenis Kaubrė\\n\\nTechnical Content Researcher\\n\\nVytenis Kaubrė is a Technical Content Researcher at Oxylabs.

Interoperability**\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nAI agents offer a unique opportunity to help people be more productive by autonomously handling many daily recurring or complex tasks. Today, enterprises are increasingly building and deploying autonomous agents to help scale, automate and enhance processes throughout the workplace–from ordering new laptops, to aiding customer service representatives, to assisting in supply chain planning.\\n\\nTo maximize the benefits from agentic AI, it is critical for these agents to be able to collaborate in a dynamic, multi-agent ecosystem across siloed data systems and applications. Enabling agents to interoperate with each other, even if they were built by different vendors or in a different framework, will increase autonomy and multiply productivity gains, while lowering long-term costs.\\n\\n**Today, we’re launching a new, open protocol called Agent2Agent (A2A), with support and contributions from more than 50 technology partners** like Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, Langchain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, BCG, Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey, PwC, TCS, and Wipro. The A2A protocol will allow AI agents to communicate with each other, securely exchange information, and coordinate actions on top of various enterprise platforms or applications. We believe the A2A framework will add significant value for customers, whose AI agents will now be able to work across their entire enterprise application estates.\\n\\nThis collaborative effort signifies a shared vision of a future when AI agents, regardless of their underlying technologies, can seamlessly collaborate to automate complex enterprise workflows and drive unprecedented levels of efficiency and innovation.\\n\\nA2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic\\'s Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents. Drawing on Google\\'s internal expertise in scaling agentic systems, we designed the A2A protocol to address the challenges we identified in deploying large-scale, multi-agent systems for our customers. A2A empowers developers to build agents capable of connecting with any other agent built using the protocol and offers users the flexibility to combine agents from various providers. Critically, businesses benefit from a standardized method for managing their agents across diverse platforms and cloud environments. We believe this universal interoperability is essential for fully realizing the potential of collaborative AI agents.\\n\\n![Image 4: Google Cloud - Partners contributing to the Agent 2 Agent protocol - Accenture, Arize, Articul, ask-ai, Atlassian, BCG, Box, c3.ai, Capgemini, Chronosphere, Cognizant, Cohere, Colibra, Contextual.ai, Cotality, Datadog, and more](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-developer-goog-blog-assets/images/image1_yEPzdSr.original.png)\\n\\nA2A design principles\\n---------------------\\n\\nA2A is an open protocol that provides a standard way for agents to collaborate with each other, regardless of the underlying framework or vendor. While designing the protocol with our partners, we adhered to five key principles:\\n\\n*   **Embrace agentic capabilities**: A2A focuses on enabling agents to collaborate in their natural, unstructured modalities, even when they don’t share memory, tools and context. We are enabling true multi-agent scenarios without limiting an agent to a “tool.”\\n\\n*   **Build on existing standards:** The protocol is built on top of existing, popular standards including HTTP, SSE, JSON-RPC, which means it’s easier to integrate with existing IT stacks businesses already use daily.\\n\\n*   **Secure by default**: A2A is designed to support enterprise-grade authentication and authorization, with parity to OpenAPI’s authentication schemes at launch.\\n\\n*   **Support for long-running tasks:** We designed A2A to be flexible and support scenarios where it excels at completing everything from quick tasks to deep research that may take hours and or even days when humans are in the loop. Throughout this process, A2A can provide real-time feedback, notifications, and state updates to its users.\\n\\n*   **Modality agnostic:** The agentic world isn’t limited to just text, which is why we’ve designed A2A to support various modalities, including audio and video streaming.\\n\\n****How A2A works\\n-----------------\\n\\n![Image 5: an illustrated flow chart showing the flow of data between the remote agent and the client agent to produce secure collaboration, task and state management, user experience negotiation, and capability discovery](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-developer-goog-blog-assets/images/image5_VkAG0Kd.original.png)\\n\\nA2A facilitates communication between a \"client\" agent and a “remote” agent. A client agent is responsible for formulating and communicating tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for acting on those tasks in an attempt to provide the correct information or take the correct action. This interaction involves several key capabilities:\\n\\n*   **Capability discovery:** Agents can advertise their capabilities using an “Agent Card” in JSON format, allowing the client agent to identify the best agent that can perform a task and leverage A2A to communicate with the remote agent.\\n\\n*   **Task management:** The communication between a client and remote agent is oriented towards task completion, in which agents work to fulfill end-user requests. This “task” object is defined by the protocol and has a lifecycle. It can be completed immediately or, for long-running tasks, each of the agents can communicate to stay in sync with each other on the latest status of completing a task. The output of a task is known as an “artifact.”\\n\\n*   **Collaboration:** Agents can send each other messages to communicate context, replies, artifacts, or user instructions.\\n\\n*   **User experience negotiation:** Each message includes “parts,” which is a fully formed piece of content, like a generated image. Each part has a specified content type, allowing client and remote agents to negotiate the correct format needed and explicitly include negotiations of the user’s UI capabilities–e.g., iframes, video, web forms, and more.\\n\\nSee the full details of how the protocol works in our [draft specification](https://github.com/google/A2A).\\n\\n****A real-world example: candidate sourcing\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nSorry, your browser doesn\\'t support playback for this video\\n\\nright click to view in new tab\\n\\nHiring a software engineer can be significantly simplified with A2A collaboration. Within a unified interface like Agentspace, a user (e.g., a hiring manager) can task their agent to find candidates matching a job listing, location, and skill set. The agent then interacts with other specialized agents to source potential candidates. The user receives these suggestions and can then direct their agent to schedule further interviews, streamlining the candidate sourcing process. After the interview process completes, another agent can be engaged to facilitate background checks. This is just one example of how AI agents need to collaborate across systems to source a qualified job candidate.\\n\\nThe future of agent interoperability\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nA2A has the potential to unlock a new era of agent interoperability, fostering innovation and creating more powerful and versatile agentic systems. We believe that this protocol will pave the way for a future where agents can seamlessly collaborate to solve complex problems and enhance our lives.\\n\\nWe’re committed to building the protocol in collaboration with our partners and the community in the open. We’re releasing the protocol as open source and setting up clear pathways for contribution.\\n\\nReview the [full specification draft](https://github.com/google/A2A), try out code samples, and see example scenarios on the [A2A website](https://google.github.io/A2A) and learn how you can contribute.\\n\\nWe are working with partners to launch a production-ready version of the protocol later this year.\\n\\n****Feedback from our A2A partners\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nWe\\'re thrilled to have a growing and diverse ecosystem of partners actively contributing to the definition of the A2A protocol and its technical specification.

While these protocols are relatively new, understanding their distinct roles and how they complement each other is essential for building scalable, flexible, and intelligent multi-agent systems.\\n\\nThis article aims to demystify MCP and A2A by explaining what each protocol is, why they are needed, and how they function in real-world applications. Through a detailed example use case—a smart building visitor management system—you will see how these protocols enable agents to access external tools and data (via MCP) and collaborate seamlessly as autonomous peers (via A2A). By following this example, you will gain a clear understanding of the differences between MCP and A2A, their complementary nature, and practical insights into how they can be integrated to create robust AI ecosystems.\\n\\nWhat Are MCP and A2A?\\n\\nMCP (Model Context Protocol)\\n\\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized protocol developed by Anthropic that enables AI systems to connect to MCP servers, which provide specific capabilities and external resources. It functions similarly to how USB-C standardizes connections for electronic devices. When an agent, such as a large language model (LLM), connects to an MCP server, it can utilize its capabilities to call functions, execute queries, or listen to events.\\n\\nExample: An MCP server with facial recognition capability may expose:\\n\\nA2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)\\n\\nA2A is a protocol developed by Google that enables direct communication between agents using two primary communication models:\\n\\n1.

Asynchronous Communication (Notifications):\\n\\nOngoing updates and longer processing times\\nServer-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming updates\\nSuitable for complex tasks requiring progress tracking\\nImplemented through tasks/sendSubscribe method\\n\\nThis dual communication model enables seamless collaboration between agents, even across different frameworks and vendors.\\n\\nHow Agents Find and Connect to Each Other\\n\\nMCP Discovery & Connection\\n\\n1.

In early 2025, two distinct protocols emerged to address this — **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. Whether you’re a developer or not, anyone building AI products or agentic systems should understand the foundational architecture — because it shapes how we design products, user interactions, ecosystems, and long-term growth. With MCP servers now integrated into IDEs and coding agents, the way developers interact with tools is fundamentally changing. An agent (as an MCP client) could connect to many of these servers at once — unlocking workflows that previously required custom integrations or tightly bound apps.\\n\\nFULL CONTENT:\\n![Logto logo](/assets/logo-D-TlE39r.webp)\\n\\n# A2A vs MCP: Two complementary protocols for the emerging agent ecosystem\\n\\nThis article introduces A2A and MCP — two emerging protocols shaping the future of AI agent systems. It explains how they work, how they differ, and why understanding this architecture matters for developers, designers, and AI product builders.\\n\\n![Guamian](/assets/guamian-CP4iysjb.png)\\n\\n4/11/20259 min read\\n\\n![Product screenshot](/assets/product-features-Bk9JAhsM.png)\\n\\nThe increasing adoption of AI agents — autonomous or semi-autonomous software entities that perform reasoning and actions on behalf of users — is giving rise to a new layer in application architecture.\\n\\nIn early 2025, two distinct protocols emerged to address this — **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. One simple way to understand their roles is:\\n\\n**A2A**: How do agents interact with each other\\n\\n**MCP**: How do agents interact with tools or external context\\n\\n![a2a_mcp.png](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/a2a_mcp_4155b038ac.png)\\nreference: <https://google.github.io/A2A/#/topics/a2a_and_mcp>\\n\\n![a2a_mcp.png](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/a2a_mcp_4155b038ac.png)\\n\\nThey address the core challenge of building systems with **multiple agents, multiple LLMs, and multiple sources of context** — all needing to collaborate.\\n\\nOne way to frame it is: “MCP provides vertical integration (application-to-model), while A2A provides horizontal integration (agent-to-agent)\\n\\nWhether you’re a developer or not, anyone building AI products or agentic systems should understand the foundational architecture — because it shapes how we design products, user interactions, ecosystems, and long-term growth.\\n\\nThis article introduces both protocols in a simple, easy-to-understand way and highlights key takeaways for developers and AI product builders.\\n\\n## What is A2A (Agent-to-Agent)?[#](/a2a-mcp#what-is-a2a-agent-to-agent)\\n\\n**A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** is an open protocol developed by Google and over 50 industry partners. Its purpose is to enable **interoperability between agents** — regardless of who built them, where they’re hosted, or what framework they use.\\n\\n### A2A protocol mechanism[#](/a2a-mcp#a2a-protocol-mechanism)\\n\\nA2A uses **JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S)** as the communication mechanism, with support for **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to stream updates.\\n\\n### A2A communication models[#](/a2a-mcp#a2a-communication-models)\\n\\nA2A defines a structured model for how two agents interact. One agent takes the role of the **“client” agent**, which initiates a request or task, and another acts as the **“remote” agent**, which receives the request and attempts to fulfill it . The client agent first may perform **capability discovery** to figure out which agent is best suited for a given job.\\n\\nHere comes to a question, how agent discover each other. Each agent can publish an **Agent Card** (a JSON metadata document, often hosted at a standard URL like `/.well-known/agent.json`) describing its capabilities, skills, API endpoints, and auth requirements.\\n\\n`/.well-known/agent.json`\\n\\nBy reading an Agent Card, a client agent can identify a suitable partner agent for the task at hand – essentially a directory of what that agent knows or can do. Once a target agent is chosen, the client agent formulates a **Task** object to send over.\\n\\n![a2a_task.png](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/a2a_task_205a4b227f.png)\\nreference: <https://google.github.io/A2A/#/>\\n\\n![a2a_task.png](https://uploads.strapi.logto.io/a2a_task_205a4b227f.png)\\n\\n### Task management[#](/a2a-mcp#task-management)\\n\\nAll interaction in A2A is oriented around performing tasks. A task is a structured object (defined by the protocol’s schema) that includes details of the request and tracks its state .\\n\\nIn A2A, each agent plays one of two roles:\\n\\nTasks can include any form of work: generate a report, retrieve data, initiate a workflow. Results are returned as **artifacts**, and agents can send structured **messages** during execution to coordinate or clarify.\\n\\n### Collaboration and content negotiation[#](/a2a-mcp#collaboration-and-content-negotiation)\\n\\nA2A supports more than simple task requests — agents can exchange **rich, multi-part messages** that include text, JSON, images, video, or interactive content. This enables **format negotiation** based on what each agent can handle or display.\\n\\nFor example, a remote agent could return a chart as either raw data or an image, or request to open an interactive form. This design supports flexible, **modality-agnostic** communication, without requiring agents to share internal tools or memory.\\n\\n### Use case example[#](/a2a-mcp#use-case-example)\\n\\nHere’s a **real-world example** of how A2A could be used in an enterprise scenario:\\n\\nA new employee is hired at a large company. Multiple systems and departments are involved in onboarding:\\n\\nTraditionally, these steps are handled manually or through tightly coupled integrations between internal systems.\\n\\nInstead of custom APIs between every system, each department exposes its own agent using the A2A protocol:\\n\\n| **Agent** | **Responsibility** |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| hr-agent.company.com | Create employee record, send documents |\\n| it-agent.company.com | Create email account, order laptop |\\n| facilities-agent.company.com | Assign desk, print access badge |\\n\\nA multi-agent system — let’s call it **OnboardingPro** (e.g. onboarding-agent.company.com) — coordinates the entire onboarding workflow.\\n\\n`.well-known/agent.json`\\n`createEmployee`\\n`setupEmailAccount`\\n`orderHardware`\\n`assignDesk`\\n`generateBadge`\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg aria-roledescription=\\'sequence\\'

Action\\n=============================================================\\n\\nThe landscape of AI development is rapidly evolving beyond single-agent systems toward interconnected ecosystems where agents can communicate, collaborate, and share capabilities. Two emerging protocols are making this vision a reality: **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. In this post, we\\'ll explore how these protocols work together to create powerful, modular AI systems through practical code examples.\\n\\n[](https://dev.to/sreeni5018/building-ai-agent-ecosystems-a2a-and-mcp-protocols-in-action-44b0#understanding-the-protocol-landscape) Understanding the Protocol

The development of these sophisticated communication protocols rests on several key innovations in AI architecture and infrastructure.\\n\\nFoundation models with strong reasoning capabilities have been crucial enablers of effective inter-model and inter-agent communication. Models like [OpenAI\\'s GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4) and [Anthropic\\'s Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) have demonstrated unprecedented ability to understand and generate structured information, making them capable of following complex protocols and maintaining coherent context across extended interactions. This reasoning capability is essential for meaningful collaboration between models and agents.\\n\\nSimilarly, advances in parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques have enabled the development of specialized models that maintain compatibility with standardized communication protocols. Methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) allow for the creation of domain-specific models without diverging completely from the base capabilities needed for effective inter-model communication. This balance between specialization and standardization is crucial for building sophisticated multi-model systems.\\n\\nThe development of vector databases and efficient embedding techniques has also played a critical role, particularly for MCP implementations. These technologies enable models to maintain and retrieve relevant contextual information throughout complex, multi-step processes. Tools like [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) and [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) provide the infrastructure needed for sophisticated context management across different components of an AI system.\\n\\nAdvances in distributed systems architecture have been equally important for A2A protocol implementation. The ability to efficiently coordinate multiple autonomous components operating asynchronously is fundamental to effective agent collaboration. Technologies from the distributed systems domain, including consensus algorithms, distributed state management, and efficient message passing, have all found new applications in multi-agent AI systems.\\n\\nContainer orchestration platforms like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) have also contributed to the practical implementation of these protocols by providing infrastructure for deploying, scaling, and managing the distributed components that make up sophisticated multi-agent systems. These platforms enable the dynamic allocation of resources to different agents based on changing needs and workloads, supporting more efficient and resilient agent networks.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n### Protocols in Action\\n\\nExamining specific implementations of MCP and A2A protocols in real-world applications provides valuable insights into their practical impact and future potential. Several notable case studies demonstrate the transformative power of these communication frameworks.\\n\\n#### Microsoft\\'s Autogen: Orchestrating Specialized Agents\\n\\n[Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/research/) has developed Autogen as a comprehensive framework for building applications using multiple conversational agents. Autogen exemplifies sophisticated A2A protocol implementation, providing a structured approach to communication between specialized agents with different capabilities and roles.\\n\\nOne particularly innovative aspect of Autogen is its approach to human-in-the-loop collaboration. The framework implements communication protocols that support fluid interaction between human users and multiple AI agents, enabling collaborative problem-solving that leverages both human insight and AI capabilities. This approach has proven particularly valuable in complex domains like software development and data analysis, where human expertise and AI processing power are both essential.\\n\\nAutogen\\'s implementation of A2A protocols emphasizes flexibility and extensibility. The framework supports different types of agent interactions, from simple request-response patterns to complex multi-turn negotiations. It also enables agents to use tools and external resources, extending their capabilities beyond what\\'s possible with language models alone. This tool use capability, coordinated through standardized protocols, significantly expands what multi-agent systems can accomplish.\\n\\nReal-world applications of Autogen include coding assistants that collaborate to solve programming problems, research agents that gather and synthesize information from multiple sources, and business process automation with specialized agent roles. In each case, Autogen\\'s implementation of A2A protocols enables more sophisticated collaboration than would be possible with isolated models or simpler integration approaches.\\n\\n#### LangChain\\'s Context Management\\n\\n[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted frameworks implementing aspects of Model Context Protocol. Its approach to context management provides a practical example of how MCP can be implemented to enable sophisticated multi-model applications.\\n\\nLangChain\\'s \"Memory\" systems demonstrate how context can be maintained across multiple interactions and different components of an AI system. These memory systems implement standardized ways to store, retrieve, and update contextual information, ensuring that important context isn\\'t lost as users interact with different parts of a complex application. This capability is essential for creating coherent, contextually aware AI systems that span multiple models or components.\\n\\nThe framework\\'s approach to \"Chains\" also exemplifies MCP implementation. Chains provide standardized ways to connect multiple LLM calls or tools together, passing relevant context between different components while maintaining a coherent overall interaction. This modular approach to AI system design, enabled by consistent context-passing protocols, allows developers to build sophisticated applications from simpler components.\\n\\nLangChain\\'s integration with external tools and data sources through standardized interfaces represents another important aspect of MCP implementation. By defining consistent ways for language models to interact with databases, APIs, and other external resources, LangChain enables the development of AI systems that combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the specific capabilities of specialized tools.\\n\\nReal-world applications built with LangChain include document question-answering systems that maintain context across complex multi-document analyses, conversational agents that combine multiple specialized models for different aspects of interaction, and data analysis workflows that integrate language models with specialized analytical tools.\\n\\n[Share](https://futurescouting.substack.com/p/how-mcp-and-a2a-protocols-are-reshaping-e70?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share)\\n\\n#### CrewAI and Role-Based Agent Collaboration\\n\\n[CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI), developed as an open-source framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous AI agents, provides another instructive example of A2A protocol implementation. CrewAI focuses on creating \"crews\" of agents with specific roles, each contributing their specialized capabilities to achieve complex goals.\\n\\nWhat makes CrewAI\\'s approach to A2A protocols particularly interesting is its emphasis on role-based communication and task delegation. The framework implements protocols that define how agents with different roles should interact, including how tasks should be assigned, how progress should be reported, and how conflicts should be resolved. This structured approach to agent interaction enables more effective collaboration on complex tasks.\\n\\nThe framework\\'s implementation of process management protocols is also noteworthy. CrewAI includes mechanisms for breaking complex tasks into manageable steps, assigning those steps to appropriate agents based on their roles, and tracking progress toward overall goals. These process management capabilities, implemented through standardized communication protocols, enable agent networks to tackle problems that would be too complex for single agents.\\n\\nReal-world applications of CrewAI include market research teams with specialized analyst roles, content creation pipelines with writers, editors, and fact-checkers, and business analysis with different domain experts. In each case, CrewAI\\'s implementation of A2A protocols enables more sophisticated collaboration than would be possible with isolated models or simpler integration approaches.\\n\\n### Economic and Strategic Implications\\n\\nThe emergence of MCP and A2A protocols has significant economic and strategic implications for organizations across industries. These standardized communication frameworks are not merely technical innovations, they represent a fundamental shift in how organizations can deploy and leverage AI capabilities.\\n\\nFor enterprises, the adoption of standardized protocols for AI communication enables more flexible, adaptable AI architectures. Rather than committing to monolithic AI systems that may become outdated as technologies evolve, organizations can build modular systems where individual components can be updated or replaced without disrupting the entire architecture. This modularity significantly reduces the risk of technological lock-in and enables more agile adaptation to emerging capabilities.\\n\\nThe economic implications of this architectural flexibility are substantial. Organizations can reduce the cost and complexity of maintaining cutting-edge AI capabilities, focusing their investments on the specific components that provide the most value for their particular needs. This approach enables more efficient allocation of resources and potentially faster return on AI investments.\\n\\nStrategic advantages also accrue to organizations that effectively implement these protocols. By creating systems where multiple specialized AI components can work together seamlessly, these organizations can deploy more sophisticated AI capabilities than competitors relying on isolated models or less integrated approaches. These capabilities can translate into competitive advantages in customer experience, operational efficiency, product innovation, and other critical areas.\\n\\nFor technology providers, the emergence of these protocols creates both opportunities and challenges. Companies that successfully establish their protocol implementations as de facto standards can potentially secure significant market advantages. At the same time, standardization may commoditize some aspects of AI infrastructure, shifting value creation toward applications and specialized components rather than foundational technologies.\\n\\nThe labor market implications are equally significant. As more sophisticated AI collaboration becomes possible through these protocols, demand will increase for professionals who understand how to design and implement effective multi-model and multi-agent systems. Skills in AI orchestration, system architecture, and protocol implementation will become increasingly valuable, potentially reshaping the landscape of AI-related professions.\\n\\nFrom a broader economic perspective, the widespread adoption of these protocols could accelerate the productivity gains from AI adoption. By enabling more sophisticated automation of complex processes and more effective collaboration between human experts and AI systems, these protocols could contribute to significant productivity growth across multiple sectors of the economy.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n### Ethical Considerations and Governance Frameworks\\n\\nAs MCP and A2A protocols enable increasingly autonomous and sophisticated AI systems, ethical considerations and governance frameworks become critically important. The potential risks and challenges associated with these technologies require thoughtful approaches to ensuring responsible development and deployment.\\n\\nOne significant concern is transparency and accountability in complex multi-model or multi-agent systems. When multiple AI components collaborate through standardized protocols, understanding how decisions are made and assigning responsibility for outcomes becomes more challenging. Protocols that support explainability and auditability become crucial for addressing these challenges, enabling stakeholders to understand how complex AI systems arrive at their conclusions or recommendations.\\n\\nOrganizations like [Partnership on AI](https://partnershiponai.org/) and the [IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems](https://ethicsstandards.org/) are working to develop principles and frameworks for responsible implementation of these technologies. These efforts focus on ensuring that multi-model and multi-agent systems remain aligned with human values and subject to appropriate oversight, even as they become more autonomous and sophisticated.\\n\\nPrivacy considerations are particularly important for MCP implementations, as these protocols involve sharing contextual information across different components of an AI system. Ensuring that sensitive information is handled appropriately throughout these complex systems requires careful protocol design and robust governance frameworks. Approaches like federated learning and differential privacy offer potential solutions for maintaining privacy while enabling effective context sharing.\\n\\nSecurity concerns become even more pronounced with A2A protocols, as these enable autonomous interaction between different agents. Protecting against malicious agents, preventing unauthorized access to agent networks, and ensuring the integrity of agent communications all require sophisticated security measures integrated into the protocols themselves. Cryptographic verification, secure communication channels, and robust authentication mechanisms will be essential components of secure A2A implementations.\\n\\nQuestions of autonomy and human oversight are also central to the governance of these technologies. As AI systems become more capable of autonomous operation through sophisticated A2A protocols, determining appropriate levels of human involvement becomes crucial. Different applications may require different balances between autonomy and oversight, depending on factors like risk, impact, and regulatory requirements.\\n\\nRegulatory frameworks are beginning to emerge that will shape the development and deployment of these protocols. The European Union\\'s AI Act, for instance, includes provisions relevant to autonomous AI systems and their governance. As these regulations mature, they will likely include specific requirements for transparency, accountability, and human oversight in systems that implement advanced communication protocols.\\n\\nIndustry self-regulation will also play an important role. Organizations developing and deploying these technologies have responsibilities to ensure their ethical implementation. Voluntary standards, best practices, and certification programs focused specifically on multi-model and multi-agent systems could complement formal regulations and help establish norms for responsible use.\\n\\n### The Foundation for Next-Generation AI Ecosystems\\n\\nAs we\\'ve explored throughout this analysis, Model Context Protocol and Agent-to-Agent communication frameworks represent far more than technical specifications—they form the foundation for a new generation of AI systems capable of unprecedented collaboration, adaptability, and sophistication. These standardized communication protocols are enabling a fundamental shift from isolated AI components to integrated ecosystems where multiple specialized elements work together to achieve complex goals.\\n\\nThis transition mirrors historical patterns we\\'ve seen in other technological domains, where the development of standardized communication protocols unlocked new capabilities and efficiencies that transformed entire industries. Just as HTTP and related protocols enabled the emergence of the modern web, MCP and A2A protocols are creating the infrastructure for AI systems that are more than the sum of their parts.\\n\\nFor organizations navigating the rapidly evolving AI landscape, understanding and strategically implementing these protocols will be increasingly crucial. Those that successfully leverage these communication frameworks to build modular, adaptable AI architectures will be positioned to deploy more sophisticated capabilities more efficiently than competitors relying on less integrated approaches.\\n\\nThe challenges ahead are significant, from technical hurdles around standardization and security to ethical questions about autonomy and oversight. Addressing these challenges will require collaborative effort across the AI community, including researchers, developers, business leaders, policymakers, and civil society organizations. The governance frameworks and ethical principles we develop for these technologies will be as important as the technical innovations themselves.\\n\\nAs MCP and A2A protocols continue to mature, they promise to enable new applications and capabilities that we\\'re only beginning to imagine. From healthcare to transportation, from scientific research to creative endeavors, the potential impact of sophisticated AI collaboration spans virtually every domain of human activity. By establishing the communication infrastructure for next-generation AI systems, these protocols may ultimately prove to be among the most consequential developments in the field\\'s evolution.\\n\\nWe stand at the beginning of this transformation, witnessing the silent revolution of AI communication protocols as they reshape what\\'s possible with artificial intelligence. The full impact of these developments will only become apparent in the years ahead, as standardization efforts mature, implementation approaches converge, and innovative applications emerge. What seems clear already, however, is that the future of AI lies not just in more capable individual models, but in the sophisticated collaboration that these communication protocols make possible.\\n\\nIn this new era of AI development, the protocols that enable models and agents to communicate effectively may ultimately prove as important as the capabilities of the models themselves. By creating the foundation for truly collaborative artificial intelligence, MCP and A2A protocols are quietly reshaping the future of AI—and with it, the future of human-AI collaboration across countless domains of our increasingly interconnected world.\\n\\n**Even in this field, we are only at the beginning.**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThanks for reading Future Scouting & Innovation!
